# Workstream

Workstream is Flow's task evaluation and contribution infrastructure.

Workstream manages project guides, task queues, submission packets, automated
checks, reviewer routing, evaluation sprints, revision loops, contribution
records, compensation award and fulfillment state, and reputation signals.

Workstream is how Flow measures, certifies, and coordinates useful human-agent work.

It is not a workspace and it is not blockchain-first. Operators can work with
any local tools, human-agent workflow, or external execution environment.
Workstream owns the project guide, task queue, submission packet, automated
checks, human review, revision loop, contribution record, conditional
compensation award and fulfillment state, and reputation record.

Workstream is source-agnostic, but v0.1 is manual-first. External origin onboarding, source adapters, automated routing, owner-agent execution workspaces, and on-chain settlement remain later adapters until the internal evaluation loop is proven.

The first 30 days are focused on building serious internal infrastructure that can run real projects end to end:

```text
Project Guide
-> Submission Artifact Policy
-> Pre-Submit Checker Policy
-> Task Queue
-> Task Record
-> Submission Packet
-> Platform Checkers
-> Human Review
-> Needs Revision / Accepted / Rejected
-> Final Acceptance on Accepted
-> Contribution Record
-> Compensation Award / Fulfillment when payable
-> Reputation Update
-> Lessons Learned
```

## Core Thesis

Different projects speak different domain languages, but serious task evaluation and contribution systems share the same lifecycle:

- every project has a guide
- every project has an approved submission artifact policy
- every task belongs to a project
- every project has an active published contribution policy version with
  explicit `accepted_submission` and `completed_review` rules, including
  explicit unpaid rules where intended
- every task has acceptance criteria
- every submission has required artifacts, evidence references, hashes, and contributor attestation
- every invalid submission packet is blocked before submission creation
- every submission passes automated checks before human review
- every review creates a decision
- every revision must close prior feedback
- every valid human review creates a reviewer contribution
- every accepted Review creates one immutable FinalAcceptance
- every submitter accepted_submission contribution consumes FinalAcceptance
- every payable contribution updates compensation fulfillment; all contributions
  can update reputation

Workstream turns that operating knowledge into reusable infrastructure.

## Authorization Baseline

Workstream verifies externally issued Flow authentication tokens and owns its
product authorization. Token role claims, email, display name, skills,
reputation, and typed workflow profiles are not product authority. Canonical
authority comes from local actor identity links, administrative grants,
exact-project contributor grants, registered permissions, resource/lifecycle
guards, revocation, and append-only evidence.

All public API documentation uses `/api/v1`. Imported reference specifications
are immutable archival inputs. ADR 0012 and the canonical authorization service
specification control authorization; ADR 0016 and the canonical contribution
and compensation specification control contribution recognition, award
eligibility, and fulfillment boundaries. Older chunk specifications remain
implementation history until their owning migrations replace the runtime.

## Engineering Loop

Workstream is built with a Codex-native zero-trust engineering loop:

```text
Intent
-> Discovery
-> Plan
-> Chunk Map
-> Chunk Contract
-> Implementation
-> Evidence
-> Internal Review
-> PR
-> Human Checkpoint
-> Memory Update
-> Stop
```

Codex-discoverable skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Codex custom reviewer
agents live in `.codex/agents/`. Durable engineering memory, policies, chunk
contracts, reviews, and status live in `.agent-loop/`.

This engineering loop is separate from Workstream product state. It governs how
the repository is changed; it does not define runtime task or review records.

## Local Backend Database

Workstream uses Postgres locally and in CI. It uses Celery with Redis for
durable local project setup jobs and automatic pre-review checker gates. MinIO
provides the S3-compatible artifact protocol in local development and CI. Start
the local services with:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio
```

MinIO uses the compose-only static credentials and the private
`workstream-artifacts` bucket. The integration tests create that bucket
automatically. For local runtime use, create the private bucket with an S3
client against `http://localhost:9000` after MinIO is healthy, using access key
`workstream-minio` and secret key `workstream-minio-secret-key`, before starting
Workstream. Configure the runtime with the exact
[artifact storage settings](docs/spec_artifact_storage_service.md#s3-compatible-adapter).
Native AWS S3 accepts workload-identity configuration but remains
runtime-ineligible until live deployment proof is approved; startup fails with
`artifact_provider_live_proof_required` before credential probing or provider
I/O.

The default local development URL is:

```text
postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream
```

Destructive real API drills use the separate local test database:

```text
postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test
```

Project guide sufficiency, submission artifact policy derivation, and
post-submit checker policy derivation run through the OpenAI Agents SDK adapter.
Install the backend agent extra and set the model explicitly before running
automatic project setup:

```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[agents]"
```

```text
WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_OPENAI_AGENT_SDK_MODEL=<approved-model>
WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_RUN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800
WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_MAX_PROMPT_BYTES=2000000
OPENAI_API_KEY=<runtime-secret>
WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_SETUP_PIPELINE_AUTOSTART=true
WORKSTREAM_CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

The Celery project setup pipeline uses the OpenAI Agents SDK runtime. The Celery worker
environment must include `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the approved model settings.
Persisted sufficiency and derivation agent identity is Workstream-owned; runtime
or provider-returned identity fields are not trusted as audit provenance.

Run the Celery worker before creating project guides that should automatically prepare
pre-submit policy, continue into post-submit policy derivation after setup
submission artifact policy approval, and advance locked submissions through the
automatic pre-review checker gate:

```bash
cd backend
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream \
WORKSTREAM_AUTH_PROVIDER=flow \
WORKSTREAM_ENVIRONMENT=local \
WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_OPENAI_AGENT_SDK_MODEL=<approved-model> \
OPENAI_API_KEY=<runtime-secret> \
WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_SETUP_PIPELINE_AUTOSTART=true \
WORKSTREAM_CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 \
.venv/bin/celery -A app.workers.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO
```

## Day-30 Success Standard

By day 30, Workstream runs a real internal task cycle with real people:

```text
Create project guide
Create task
Assign task
Submit packet
Run checks
Review packet
Record review decision: accept, needs_revision, or reject
Create reviewer contribution for every valid human review
On accept, create FinalAcceptance then create the submitter contribution only from it
Record compensation status only for payable contribution awards
Update reputation from review outcome
Review lessons learned
```

The system is successful only if it prevents weak work from reaching review,
preserves evidence, and gives operators a clear path from task intake through
review, contribution, conditional compensation, and fulfillment.

## Operating Standard

Workstream is built as durable operational infrastructure:

Governance:

- project rules live in guides and policies, not chat memory
- guide and policy versions are locked per task so rules do not drift silently
- out-of-band guidance is not enforceable until it becomes a guide, policy, template, or checker contract update

Lifecycle and revision:

- status is a ledger, not a loose label
- revisions replay prior findings one by one
- revision context is prepared before resubmission when guide or policy versions change

Artifacts, evidence, and auditing:

- reviews cite evidence and required changes
- submitted artifacts are immutable and hash-bound to checker runs
- every checker result is stored and auditable

Contribution and compensation:

- every valid human review creates a reviewer contribution from locked evidence
- accepted work creates an immutable FinalAcceptance, which is the sole source
  for the submitter contribution
- only payable contributions create immutable awards and fulfillment tracking;
  explicit unpaid rules create none
- compensation fulfillment is recorded separately from task acceptance

Checkers, lessons, and gates:

- lessons learned become guide updates or new checkers
- quality gates remain separate: project activation, task screening, and submission quality

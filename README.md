# Workstream

Workstream is Flow's task evaluation and contribution infrastructure.

Workstream manages project guides, task queues, submission packets, automated checks, reviewer routing, evaluation sprints, revision loops, contribution records, payment status, and reputation signals.

Workstream is how Flow measures, certifies, and coordinates useful human-agent work.

It is not a workspace and it is not blockchain-first. Operators can work with any local tools, human-agent workflow, or external execution environment. Workstream owns the project guide, task queue, submission packet, automated checks, human review, revision loop, acceptance state, payment ledger, and reputation record.

Workstream is source-agnostic, but v0.1 is manual-first. External origin onboarding, source adapters, automated routing, owner-agent execution workspaces, and on-chain settlement remain later adapters until the internal evaluation loop is proven.

The first 30 days are focused on building serious internal infrastructure that can run real projects end to end:

```text
Project Guide
-> Task Queue
-> Task Record
-> Submission Packet
-> Platform Checkers
-> Human Review
-> Needs Revision / Accepted / Rejected
-> Contribution Record
-> Payment Record
-> Reputation Update
-> Lessons Learned
```

## Core Thesis

Different projects speak different domain languages, but serious task evaluation and contribution systems share the same lifecycle:

- every project has a guide
- every task belongs to a project
- every project has a base amount or payment policy
- every task has acceptance criteria
- every submission has evidence
- every submission passes automated checks before human review
- every review creates a decision
- every revision must close prior feedback
- every accepted task updates payment and reputation

Workstream turns that operating knowledge into reusable infrastructure.

## Local Backend Database

Workstream uses Postgres locally and in CI. Start the local database with:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

The default local test URL is:

```text
postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream
```

## Week 1 API Demo UI

The Week 1 API demo UI lives in `demos/week1_api_demo_ui/`. It is a temporary walkthrough client for the Week 1 backend APIs, not the canonical Workstream frontend implementation. It calls the real backend over HTTP through the Vite proxy and uses local Flow-style bearer tokens against the backend `flow` verifier.

Start the backend for the demo:

```bash
cd backend
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream \
WORKSTREAM_AUTH_PROVIDER=flow \
WORKSTREAM_ENVIRONMENT=local \
WORKSTREAM_FLOW_AUTH_ISSUER=https://auth.flow.local/demo \
WORKSTREAM_FLOW_AUTH_AUDIENCE=workstream-demo \
WORKSTREAM_FLOW_AUTH_LOCAL_HMAC_SECRET=workstream-demo-local-secret \
WORKSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_ROUTES=true \
.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head

WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream \
WORKSTREAM_AUTH_PROVIDER=flow \
WORKSTREAM_ENVIRONMENT=local \
WORKSTREAM_FLOW_AUTH_ISSUER=https://auth.flow.local/demo \
WORKSTREAM_FLOW_AUTH_AUDIENCE=workstream-demo \
WORKSTREAM_FLOW_AUTH_LOCAL_HMAC_SECRET=workstream-demo-local-secret \
WORKSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_ROUTES=true \
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Start the demo UI:

```bash
cd demos/week1_api_demo_ui
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 5173
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

The demo runs the Week 1 path from project guide to locked submission using real API calls. The local demo worker-profile route is guarded by `WORKSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_ROUTES=true` and local/test environments only.

## Day-30 Success Standard

By day 30, Workstream runs a real internal task cycle with real people:

```text
Create project guide
Create task
Assign task
Submit packet
Run checks
Review packet
Record review decision: accept, needs_revision, or reject
Create contribution record for accepted work
Record payment status separately for accepted work
Update reputation from review outcome
Review lessons learned
```

The system is successful only if it prevents weak work from reaching review, preserves evidence, and gives operators a clear path from task intake to accepted paid output.

## Operating Standard

Workstream is built as durable operational infrastructure:

Governance:

- project rules live in guides and policies, not chat memory
- guide and policy versions are locked per task so rules do not drift silently
- out-of-band guidance is not enforceable until it becomes a guide, policy, template, or checker contract update

Lifecycle and revision:

- status is a ledger, not a loose label
- revisions replay prior findings one by one
- revision context is prepared before resubmission when guide or policy versions change

Artifacts, evidence, and auditing:

- reviews cite evidence and required changes
- submitted artifacts are immutable and hash-bound to checker runs
- every checker result is stored and auditable

Acceptance and payment:

- accepted work cites evidence before payment exposure is created
- accepted work creates an evidence-backed contribution record before payment or reputation updates
- payments are recorded separately from task acceptance

Checkers, lessons, and gates:

- lessons learned become guide updates or new checkers
- quality gates remain separate: project activation, task screening, and submission quality

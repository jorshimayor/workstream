# Product Strategy Review

Review scope: markdown docs only.

## Findings

### High: 30-day scope needs a first thin slice before the full MVP

The plan defines the full 30-day loop, but it does not explicitly name the smallest usable workflow that must be working first. Without that, the team may build broad modules in parallel and miss the first operator value.

Suggested change: add a "Day 7 Thin Slice" that proves `Project -> Task -> Submission -> Checker Result -> Review Decision` with one project, one task, one checker, and one reviewer.

### High: Recommended stack is still undecided

`docs/architecture_system_architecture.md` says backend can be Node/TypeScript or Go. For a 30-day execution plan, this leaves too much room for debate.

Suggested change: pick one v0.1 stack and treat alternatives as future decisions.

### Medium: First customer/operator value needs sharper wording

The product promise is accurate but should state the immediate value more concretely: fewer missed rules, fewer avoidable revisions, faster review readiness, and clean payout tracking.

Suggested change: add a "First Operator Value" section to the product brief.

### Medium: Manual task intake should be explicit

The docs mention source adapters later, but the first intake path should be clear. For v0.1, tasks should be created manually or imported from a simple CSV/markdown template.

Suggested change: add manual intake as the only v0.1 task source.

### Low: Success metrics should separate build metrics from pilot metrics

The metrics mix system deliverables with pilot outcomes.

Suggested change: separate "Build Success" and "Pilot Success" in the roadmap.

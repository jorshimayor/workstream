# Project Operating Manual

## Purpose

This manual defines how a project runs inside Workstream. It is the practical bridge between a project guide and daily work.

Every project has:

- active guide
- queue owner
- reviewer owner
- checker policy
- review policy
- revision policy
- payment policy
- review guard
- preflight evidence requirements
- lessons learned log

## Project Setup Checklist

Before releasing tasks:

- project name and slug exist
- project guide imported
- guide version marked active
- base amount configured
- currency configured
- allowed task types listed
- required task fields listed
- required submission fields listed
- checker policy attached
- review policy attached
- revision policy attached
- payment policy attached
- reviewer pool assigned
- review guard created from the project guide
- preflight evidence requirements defined

## v0.1 Quality Gates

### Project Activation Gate

A project cannot become active unless guide, checker policy, review policy, revision policy, evidence policy, and payment policy are present.

### Task Screening Gate

A task cannot move to `READY` until the task contract is complete, the guide version is locked, evidence requirements are clear, checker/review/revision/payment policy versions are locked, and a release decision is recorded.

### Submission Quality Gate

A submission cannot move to human review until required checkers run against the exact submission version and artifact hashes. High-severity failures return to the worker when submission-caused; platform infrastructure failures remain in checker retry handling or audited admin/project manager intervention.

External origin qualification and webhook drop notifications are future adapter concerns, not v0.1 gates.

## Task Release Checklist

Before moving a task to `READY`:

- task belongs to project
- active guide version attached
- acceptance criteria exist
- required output is explicit
- evidence requirements exist
- base amount is set
- deadline or review SLA is set
- skill tags are set
- screening/readiness gate passed
- task status snapshot created
- task creator has run the project ready gate

## Ready Gate

A task cannot move to `READY` just because it has text.

The ready gate confirms:

- guide version is active
- task fits project scope
- acceptance criteria are objective enough to review
- required evidence is clear
- payout is set
- known project failure modes have been checked
- task does not depend on private or prohibited source material

If the ready gate fails, the task remains `DRAFT`.

## Submission Intake Checklist

Before accepting a submission packet:

- task is assigned to submitter
- summary exists
- output package or reference exists
- evidence exists
- revision replay exists when task was previously `NEEDS_REVISION`
- preflight evidence record can be generated

## Reviewer Simulation Gate

Before high-value or first-of-kind tasks are released, run a reviewer simulation:

- inspect task as if rejecting it
- identify likely blocker findings
- check whether acceptance criteria are atomic
- check whether evidence requirements are sufficient
- check whether the task can be reviewed without private explanation

The output is one of:

- ready
- needs revision before release
- reject-risk

## Review Checklist

Before review decision:

- read active guide version
- read task acceptance criteria
- inspect checker results
- inspect evidence
- inspect prior findings if resubmission
- write structured findings if not accepting

## Payment Checklist

Before marking paid:

- task is accepted
- payment record exists
- accepted amount is correct
- worker identity is correct
- payment reference is recorded
- paid amount matches record

## Lessons Learned Loop

Every repeated failure becomes one of:

- guide update
- checker update
- template update
- reviewer training note
- payment policy update
- revision policy update
- task creator checklist update

Do not let repeated mistakes remain tribal knowledge.

Each lesson must have an action owner and one target:

- guide update
- checker update
- template update
- reviewer policy update
- revision policy update
- payment policy update
- project manager training note

## Weekly Project Review

Review:

- task counts by status
- accepted work
- rejected work
- needs-revision reasons
- checker failures
- reviewer quality
- pending payout
- paid total
- lessons learned

Output:

- policy changes
- checker backlog
- guide amendments
- revision policy amendments
- payment policy amendments
- project manager training notes

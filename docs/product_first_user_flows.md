# First User Flows

The first user flows prove that Workstream can run real work from intake to acceptance. These flows come before any advanced routing or settlement.

## Flow 1: Admin Creates A Project

1. Admin creates project.
2. Project owner provides open-ended guide material and business terms.
3. Admin or project_manager adds the guide.
4. Workstream runs `ProjectGuideSufficiencyAgent` against the immutable guide-source snapshot.
5. Blocking sufficiency gaps create clarification requests for the project owner.
6. Admin or project_manager acknowledges non-blocking sufficiency warnings.
7. Workstream runs `SubmissionArtifactPolicyDerivationAgent`.
8. Admin or project_manager reviews and approves the derived submission artifact policy.
9. Workstream persists the effective project submission artifact policy hash.
10. Workstream compiles, persists, and locks the project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy`.
11. Admin or project_manager enables post-submit checker policy.
12. Admin or project_manager enables review policy.
13. Admin or project_manager enables revision policy.
14. Admin or project_manager enables payment policy.
15. Project becomes active.

Acceptance:

- Project cannot become active without guide, immutable guide source snapshot, passed or acknowledged guide sufficiency report for that immutable guide source snapshot, submission artifact policy, effective project submission artifact policy hash, project pre-submit checker bundle hash, post-submit checker policy, review policy, revision policy, and payment policy.
- Submission artifact policy is Workstream-derived and approved by `admin` or `project_manager`; project owners do not author or approve the machine policy schema directly.
- This flow is the agent-derived setup path. If an admin or project_manager creates a manual sufficiency report for a snapshot, that snapshot continues through manual policy creation; agent derivation requires an agent-created sufficiency report for the same snapshot or a fresh guide-source snapshot.
- Submission artifact, checker, review, revision, and payment policies are visible on the project page.

## Flow 2: Operator Creates A Task

1. Operator selects active project.
2. Operator creates task with title, description, expected output, acceptance criteria, deadline, and difficulty.
3. Workstream validates the task-owned contract fields and confirms the task fits the active project guide and policy bundle.
4. Task enters `SCREENING`.
5. Screening locks the guide source snapshot id/hash, effective project submission artifact policy hash, and project pre-submit checker bundle hash, then confirms task contract, post-submit checker policy, review policy, revision policy, payment policy, and reviewability.
6. Task enters `READY`.

Acceptance:

- Missing required fields block `SCREENING`.
- Missing required fields block `READY`.
- Task shows project guide, required artifacts, generated project pre-submit checker policy summary, post-submit checker policy, review policy, revision policy, and payment policy.

## Flow 3: Worker Submits Work

1. Worker opens assigned task.
2. Worker attaches output files or links.
3. Worker attaches evidence.
4. Worker writes submission notes.
5. Workstream executes the task's locked project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy`.
6. Preflight failures return `PreSubmitCheckResponse`; blocked submission-create attempts return `pre_submission_checker_failed` with structured pass/fail/warning details and create no submission.
7. When blocking pre-submit checks pass, Worker submits packet.
8. Task enters `SUBMITTED`.

Acceptance:

- Submission cannot be created when blocking pre-submit checks fail.
- Blocking pre-submit failures are not review decisions and never return `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`.
- Submission cannot be created without required artifacts, evidence references, hashes, and worker attestation defined by the locked project pre-submit checker policy.
- Submission packet is immutable after checks start.

## Flow 4: Automated Checks Run

1. Checker runner validates the submission-stamped locked `PostSubmitCheckerPolicy` id/version/hash/body.
2. Runner executes enabled checks from that locked policy body.
3. Results are saved with `passed`, `warning`, or `failed`, plus severity, message, and evidence.
4. If worker-fixable blocking failures exist, task enters `NEEDS_REVISION`.
5. If setup or provenance defects exist, the task stays in the internal operations queue.
6. If no blocking failures exist, task enters `REVIEW_PENDING`.

Acceptance:

- High-severity failure blocks human review.
- Warnings remain visible to reviewer.
- Every checker result is timestamped.

## Flow 5: Reviewer Reviews Submission

1. Reviewer opens review queue.
2. Reviewer selects `REVIEW_PENDING` task.
3. Reviewer reads guide, task, submission, evidence, and checker results.
4. Reviewer enters structured findings.
5. Reviewer selects accept, needs_revision, or reject.

Acceptance:

- Review cannot be submitted without a decision.
- needs_revision and reject require at least one finding.
- accept requires no unresolved high-severity checker failure.

## Flow 6: Revision Replay

1. Worker opens needs-revision task.
2. Workstream prepares revision context from the revision policy.
3. Worker sees prior guide/policy version, next guide/policy version, and any change summary when the task was rebased.
4. Worker sees each finding as a checklist item.
5. Worker adds fix note and evidence per finding.
6. Worker resubmits.
7. Checkers rerun.
8. Reviewer closes or reopens each finding.

Acceptance:

- Prior review remains visible.
- Context changes are visible before the worker revises.
- Each required finding has a closure state.
- Revision count is tracked against the locked revision policy.
- Resubmission is blocked or rejected when the revision policy limit or deadline says so.

## Flow 7: Accepted Work Creates Contribution Record

1. Reviewer accepts task.
2. Task enters `ACCEPTED`.
3. Contribution record is created from accepted submission, accepting review, guide version, evidence refs, and artifact hashes.
4. Payment record is created or updated as `PENDING`.
5. Worker reputation updates from the contribution record.
6. Project dashboard updates.

Acceptance:

- Accepted task cannot lack contribution record.
- Accepted task cannot lack payment record.
- Payment status is separate from assignment status.

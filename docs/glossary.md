# Glossary

## Workstream

Flow's task evaluation and contribution infrastructure: the system for project guides, task queues, submission packets, automated checks, reviewer routing, evaluation sprints, revision loops, contribution records, payment status, and reputation signals.

## Project

A configured work program with its own human-facing guide, submission artifact policy, checker policies, review policy, revision policy, payment policy, and queue.

## Project Owner

The external or internal organization that provides open-ended project material
and business terms. That material can be markdown, URL-backed documentation,
repository docs, examples, rubrics, task instructions, base payout or payment
policy inputs, or other project-specific source material. The project owner
does not author or approve Workstream's machine-readable internal policy schema.

## ActorContext

The trusted per-request actor object resolved from a verified Flow token. It
contains the current actor id, external subject, issuer, scopes/roles when
present in the trusted request context, claim snapshot,
auth source, and display metadata. The Flow issuer plus subject is the canonical
portable identity anchor; Workstream's actor id is a local durable reference
derived from that pair. The Identity Issuer is not the source of truth for
Workstream product roles; Workstream stores and enforces product roles locally
for verified Flow subjects. In the v0.1 bootstrap, route checks may still read
trusted role claims from the current actor context until the Workstream-owned
role-assignment layer is introduced. Persisted profile rows are never route
permission grants.

## ActorIdentity

Workstream's local durable identity record for a verified Flow actor. It is
keyed by the stable Workstream actor id derived from the Flow issuer and
subject, while the issuer plus subject remains the canonical Flow identity. It
supports audit display, profile linkage, assignment history, and later
reputation records. It is not Workstream-owned authentication, login, token
issuance, or global identity authority.

## ActorProfile

Workstream's shared profile and workflow eligibility record attached to an
`ActorIdentity`. Initial profile types include worker, reviewer, admin,
project_manager, and project_owner. A profile can store status, skill tags,
scope, and metadata, but it is not the canonical role-assignment table and does
not grant route access. A project_owner profile is scoped source/contact
metadata, not project-manager authority.

`observed` profile status is audit/display metadata from verified token
observation. `active` profile status means an explicit profile workflow made
that profile eligible for the relevant Workstream workflow. Neither status is
route permission.

## Source

Where a task came from. In v0.1, sources are manual creation, controlled markdown import, or controlled CSV import.

## Origin

A future external task source that can submit tasks into Workstream through an adapter. External origin onboarding is not part of v0.1.

## Project Guide

The human-facing operating guide for a project. It contains the project instructions, quality bar, task examples, reviewer rubric, common rejection reasons, and links or summaries for the approved policies. A project guide may be markdown, an imported document, or a URL-backed guide, but runtime enforcement uses approved machine-readable policies attached to the guide version.

## Guide Sufficiency Report

The Workstream-owned sufficiency record for a project guide version and source
snapshot. It is normally produced by `ProjectGuideSufficiencyAgent`, but an
`admin` or `project_manager` can create a manual report when needed. It records
whether the guide passed, is blocked by gaps, or passed with warnings that an
`admin` or `project_manager` must acknowledge before activation. Manual reports
clear only the manual policy path; agent derivation requires an agent-created
sufficiency report for the same snapshot.

## Submission Artifact Policy

The Workstream-derived, admin-or-project-manager-approved machine-readable
contract for what a worker must submit. It is derived from open-ended project
guide material after guide sufficiency passes or passes with warnings, reviewed
by a Workstream actor with the `admin` or `project_manager` role after any
warnings are acknowledged, and attached to a project guide version. It defines
required artifacts, evidence
requirements, artifact hash requirements, allowed storage reference forms,
forbidden artifacts, attestation requirements, and project-specific packaging
rules. It can add or tighten requirements, but it cannot weaken Workstream's
default submission artifact rules.

The project-specific policy row is still `SubmissionArtifactPolicy`; Workstream
does not define a separate `ProjectSubmissionArtifactPolicy` type.

## Effective Project Submission Artifact Policy

The deterministic merge of Workstream's default submission artifact policy and the project-approved submission artifact policy. Workstream computes this effective project policy before generating the project pre-submit checker policy.

## Pre-Submit Checker Policy

The server-generated project checker matrix produced from the effective project submission artifact policy, persisted with a compiled bundle hash, and locked by tasks before they enter the worker pipeline. It runs before Workstream creates a submission row or submission version. The preflight endpoint returns `PreSubmitCheckResponse`; a blocked submission-create attempt returns `pre_submission_checker_failed` with structured pass/fail/warning details. Neither path returns review decision values: `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`.

## pre_submission_checker_failed

The worker-facing domain error code returned when a submission-create attempt is blocked by pre-submit checks. It includes structured pass/fail/warning details in the error details and is not a review decision. It must not be stored as `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`. The preflight endpoint returns `PreSubmitCheckResponse` instead of this error code.

## Task

A unit of work inside a project.

## Task Contract

The normalized task fields required for Workstream to screen, assign, check, review, pay, and audit work.

## Submission Packet

The worker's submitted output plus summary, artifacts, evidence references, hashes, and metadata. Workstream assigns the submission version server-side after blocking pre-submit checks pass.

## Checker

An automated rule that validates a task or submission before human review.

## Checker Policy

The set of required and warning checks for a project phase. Pre-submit checker policy is generated from the effective project submission artifact policy. Post-submit checker policy governs durable internal checker runs after a submission is locked.

## Human Review

The judgment layer where a reviewer accepts, rejects, or requests revision.

## Finding

A structured reviewer issue with severity, area, required fix, and evidence.

## Revision Replay

A resubmission record showing how each prior review finding was addressed.

## Evidence

Proof supporting task completion or review decision. Examples: logs, hashes, tests, screenshots, diffs, notes.

## Payment Ledger

The record of accepted amount, pending payout, paid amount, and payment state.

## Reputation Ledger

The outcome-based record of worker and reviewer performance.

## Contribution Record

The evidence-backed record that accepted work was completed under a locked project guide. Payment and reputation records attach to contribution records, but do not replace them.

## Human Owner

The person accountable for a submitted packet, even when agents or external tools helped produce the work.

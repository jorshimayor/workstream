# Glossary

## Workstream

Flow's task evaluation and contribution infrastructure: the system for project guides, task queues, submission packets, automated checks, reviewer routing, evaluation sprints, revision loops, contribution records, payment status, and reputation signals.

## Project

A configured work program with its own human-facing guide, submission artifact policy, checker policies, review policy, revision policy, payment policy, and queue.

## Project Owner

The external or internal organization that provides open-ended project material
and business terms. That material can be markdown, URL-backed documentation,
repository docs, examples, rubrics, task instructions, base payout or payment
policy inputs, or other project-specific source material. The project owner
does not author or approve Workstream's machine-readable internal policy schema.

## ActorContext

Legacy name for the trusted per-request identity context resolved from a
verified Flow token. During WS-AUTH-001 migration it is replaced by a minimal
`VerifiedIssuerToken` plus locally resolved `AuthorizationContext`. Token roles
are not Workstream product authority.

## ActorIdentity

Legacy registry record for a verified Flow actor. WS-AUTH-001 classifies each
row before migrating safe UUID actor identifiers into canonical
`ActorProfile.id` plus a new `ActorIdentityLink`. It is not a grant or
Workstream-owned authentication.

## ActorProfile

The single canonical Workstream actor root. It records actor kind and status;
it does not itself grant project or administrative authority. Verified
issuer/subject identities attach through `ActorIdentityLink`. Authority comes
from `AdminRoleGrant` or exact-project `ProjectRoleGrant` records plus resource
and lifecycle guards.

Legacy typed profile row IDs are workflow metadata IDs and never canonical
actor IDs or grants.

## ActorIdentityLink

The active-or-revoked link between one canonical issuer/opaque subject and one
ActorProfile. Raw tokens, provider credentials, and full claims are not stored.

## AdminRoleGrant

An immutable administrative authority record for Access Administrator,
Operator, Project Manager, Finance Authority, or Audit Authority at compatible
system/project scope.

## ProjectRoleGrant

An immutable exact-project contributor authority record with role `submitter`,
`reviewer`, or `both`.

## Source

Where a task came from. In v0.1, sources are manual creation, controlled markdown import, or controlled CSV import.

## Origin

A future external task source that can submit tasks into Workstream through an adapter. External origin onboarding is not part of v0.1.

## Project Guide

The human-facing operating guide for a project. It contains the project instructions, quality bar, task examples, reviewer rubric, common rejection reasons, and links or summaries for the approved policies. A project guide may be markdown, an imported document, or a URL-backed guide, but runtime enforcement uses approved machine-readable policies attached to the guide version.

## Guide Sufficiency Report

The Workstream-owned sufficiency record for a project guide version and source
snapshot. It is normally produced by `ProjectGuideSufficiencyAgent`, but an
an authorized covered Project Manager can create a manual report when needed.
It records
whether the guide passed, is blocked by gaps, or passed with warnings that an
authorized covered Project Manager must acknowledge before activation. Manual reports
clear only the manual policy path; agent derivation requires an agent-created
sufficiency report for the same snapshot.

## Project Setup Run

A non-authoritative orchestration ledger for automatic project setup. It records
queue status, current setup step, Celery task id, bounded errors, and output
record ids for guide sufficiency, submission artifact policy derivation, and
post-submit checker setup continuation. The actual policy truth remains in the
source snapshot, sufficiency report, submission artifact policy, effective
project policy, pre-submit checker policy, and post-submit checker policy rows.

## Submission Artifact Policy

The Workstream-derived, covered-Project-Manager-approved machine-readable
contract for what a worker must submit. It is derived from open-ended project
guide material after guide sufficiency passes or passes with warnings, reviewed
by an authorized covered Project Manager after any
warnings are acknowledged, and attached to a project guide version. It defines
required artifacts, evidence
requirements, artifact hash requirements, allowed storage reference forms,
forbidden artifacts, attestation requirements, and project-specific packaging
rules. It can add or tighten requirements, but it cannot weaken Workstream's
default submission artifact rules.

The project-specific policy row is still `SubmissionArtifactPolicy`; Workstream
does not define a separate `ProjectSubmissionArtifactPolicy` type.

## Effective Project Submission Artifact Policy

The deterministic merge of Workstream's default submission artifact policy and the project-approved submission artifact policy. Workstream computes this effective project policy before generating the project pre-submit checker policy.

## Pre-Submit Checker Policy

The server-generated project checker matrix produced from the effective project submission artifact policy, persisted with a compiled bundle hash, and locked by tasks before they enter the worker pipeline. It runs before Workstream creates a submission row or submission version. The preflight endpoint returns `PreSubmitCheckResponse`; a blocked submission-create attempt returns `pre_submission_checker_failed` with structured pass/fail/warning details. Neither path returns review decision values: `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`.

## pre_submission_checker_failed

The worker-facing domain error code returned when a submission-create attempt is blocked by pre-submit checks. It includes structured pass/fail/warning details in the error details and is not a review decision. It must not be stored as `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`. The preflight endpoint returns `PreSubmitCheckResponse` instead of this error code.

## Task

A unit of work inside a project.

## Task Work Context

The worker-safe API projection of a task's locked guide, project summary,
review policy, revision policy, payment policy, and lifecycle state. It is read
from the task's stamped locked context and does not expose source snapshot
hashes, private source/import refs, compiled checker bundles, checker configs,
Celery ids, or setup errors.

## Task Submission Requirements

The worker-safe API projection of the task's locked effective project
submission artifact policy. It tells the worker the exact required artifacts,
evidence keys, forbidden artifact rules, storage reference rules, packaging
rules, hash algorithm, size limits, and attestation terms before submission.

## Task Locked Context

The permission-scoped Project Manager/Operator projection of a task's locked guide and
policy provenance, including guide source snapshot id/hash, effective policy
id/hash, pre-submit checker policy id/hash, post-submit checker policy
id/hash/body summary, and review, revision, and payment policy versions.

## Task Contract

The normalized task fields required for Workstream to screen, assign, check, review, pay, and audit work.

## Submission Packet

The worker's submitted output plus summary, artifacts, evidence references, hashes, and metadata. Workstream assigns the submission version server-side after blocking pre-submit checks pass.

## Checker

An automated rule that validates a task or submission before human review.

## Checker Policy

The set of required and warning checks for a project phase. Pre-submit checker policy is generated from the effective project submission artifact policy. Post-submit checker policy governs durable internal checker runs after a submission is finalized into the pre-review gate.

## Human Review

The judgment layer where a reviewer accepts, rejects, or requests revision.

## Finding

A structured reviewer issue with severity, area, required fix, and evidence.

## Revision Replay

A resubmission record showing how each prior review finding was addressed.

## Evidence

Proof supporting task completion or review decision. Examples: logs, hashes, tests, screenshots, diffs, notes.

## Payment Ledger

The record of accepted amount, pending payout, paid amount, and payment state.

## Reputation Ledger

The outcome-based record of worker and reviewer performance.

## Contribution Record

The evidence-backed record that accepted work was completed under a locked project guide. Payment and reputation records attach to contribution records, but do not replace them.

## Human Owner

The person accountable for a submitted packet, even when agents or external tools helped produce the work.

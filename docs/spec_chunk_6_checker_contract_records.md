# Chunk 6: Checker Contract And Records

## Purpose

Chunk 6 creates the durable checker run and checker result contract for Week 2.

This chunk does not run the full checker framework yet. It defines the durable post-submit checker records, the pre-submit feedback response contract, schemas, service boundaries, and read APIs that later chunks use for static checks, internal auto checks, and review gating.

## Scope

- checker run model
- checker result model
- checker run status values
- checker result status and severity values
- trigger source fields
- routing recommendation fields
- source tracking for checker-caused `needs_revision`
- pre-submit feedback response contract
- backend read APIs for checker runs and results
- internal service method for creating checker runs/results
- migration and ORM metadata
- tests for persistence, visibility, and immutability expectations

## Non-Scope

- real checker registry
- real checker execution
- automatic background trigger after submission locking
- task lifecycle movement to `AUTO_CHECKING`, `REVIEW_PENDING`, or `NEEDS_REVISION`
- readiness certificate creation; deferred to Chunk 9 when the pre-review gate is implemented
- product frontend
- reviewer queue UI
- human review decisions
- revision replay enforcement
- contribution, payment, or reputation records

## Required Model

`checker_runs`

- `id`
- `task_id`
- `submission_id`
- `submission_version`
- `trigger_source`
- `status`
- `routing_recommendation`
- `outcome_source`
- `triggered_by`
- `triggered_by_subject`
- `triggered_by_issuer`
- `trigger_auth_source`
- `trigger_reason`
- `audit_event_id`
- `attempt_number`
- `supersedes_checker_run_id`
- `is_current_for_submission`
- `locked_guide_version`
- `locked_checker_policy_version`
- `locked_review_policy_version`
- `locked_revision_policy_version`
- `locked_payment_policy_version`
- `package_hash`
- `artifact_hash_manifest`
- `artifact_manifest_hash`
- `blocking_failure_count`
- `warning_count`
- `started_at`
- `completed_at`
- `failure_message`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

`checker_results`

- `id`
- `checker_run_id`
- `checker_id`
- `checker_name`
- `checker_version`
- `phase`
- `status`
- `severity`
- `blocks_review`
- `message`
- `suggested_fix`
- `worker_message`
- `worker_suggested_fix`
- `evidence_refs`
- `worker_evidence_refs`
- `metadata`
- `worker_visible`
- `created_at`

## Canonical Values

`checker_runs.trigger_source`

- `submission_locked`
- `manual_checker_trigger`
- `retry`

`checker_runs.status`

- `queued`
- `running`
- `completed`
- `failed`

`checker_runs.routing_recommendation`

- `not_evaluated`
- `allow_review`
- `needs_revision`
- `checker_retry`

`routing_recommendation` is not a human review decision field. It is a checker-side routing recommendation used before human review.

`allow_review` means the checker run found no blocking issue and the submission may proceed to human review. It must not be stored as `accept`, because no human reviewer has accepted the work yet.

`needs_revision` from a checker run must carry `outcome_source = auto_checker` and no review decision id. `needs_revision` from a human reviewer must carry `outcome_source = human_review` and a review decision id.

`checker_runs.outcome_source`

- `none`
- `auto_checker`

`checker_results.status`

- `pass`
- `warn`
- `fail`

`checker_results.severity`

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`

## Record Binding

Durable `checker_runs` are authoritative post-submit records only. They must bind to one locked submission version.

The run snapshots:

- `task_id`
- `submission_id`
- `submission_version`
- `package_hash`
- `artifact_hash_manifest`
- deterministic `artifact_manifest_hash`
- locked project guide version
- locked checker policy version
- locked review policy version
- locked revision policy version
- locked payment policy version

Post-submit checker runs must be created only from a loaded, locked submission. The service must copy `task_id`, `submission_version`, `package_hash`, `artifact_hash_manifest`, `artifact_manifest_hash`, and locked policy versions from that submission. The client does not provide locked guide or policy versions for checker runs.

The migration must add enough constraints or service-level tests to prove a checker run cannot bind `submission_id` to a different task, submission version, or package hash. Prefer a composite foreign key or unique binding where practical; otherwise add explicit service validation and integration tests that fail on mismatched context.

Only the current completed post-submit checker run can be used by Chunk 9's pre-review gate. Chunk 6 stores the provenance needed for that later gate:

- `attempt_number`
- `supersedes_checker_run_id`
- `is_current_for_submission`
- `completed_at`
- `artifact_manifest_hash`
- `package_hash`

## Artifact Manifest Hash

`artifact_manifest_hash` is SHA-256 over canonical UTF-8 JSON.

Normalization rules:

- validate every entry against `ArtifactHashEntry`
- sort entries by `artifact`, then `hash`
- reject duplicate `artifact` values
- serialize with sorted object keys and compact separators
- preserve all persisted fields that affect artifact identity: `artifact`, `hash`, `size_bytes`, and `notes`
- equivalent manifests with different JSON key order or entry order must produce the same hash
- any changed artifact hash, size, path, or notes must produce a different hash

## Pre-Submit Feedback Contract

Pre-submit static checks run before a submission is finalized. They return immediate API feedback without creating an authoritative post-submit checker run.

Response fields:

- `run_type = pre_submit`
- `task_id`
- `actor_id`
- `request_hash`
- `eligible_to_submit`
- `artifact_manifest_hash`
- `blocking_failure_count`
- `warning_count`
- `results`
- `submission_created = false`
- `durable_checker_run_id = null`
- `created_at`
- `expires_at`

Pre-submit feedback may bind to `task_id`, draft packet fields, package hash, and artifact manifest shape. It does not require a locked `submission_id`, locked submission version, or locked policy context.

Pre-submit results are not authoritative for `REVIEW_PENDING` and cannot create `NEEDS_REVISION`. Only post-submit runs against locked submissions can produce routing recommendations for `REVIEW_PENDING` or user-facing `needs_revision`.

## User-Facing Revision Rule

User-facing outcomes remain simple:

- `accepted`
- `rejected`
- `needs_revision`

Checker-caused revision uses the same user-facing `needs_revision` state, but records the source internally:

- `routing_recommendation = needs_revision`
- `outcome_source = auto_checker`
- `review_decision_id = null` when that field exists in later review work

Human reviewer revision remains separate later:

- `outcome = needs_revision`
- `outcome_source = human_review`
- `review_decision_id` present

Chunk 6 stores the checker-side source fields but does not implement human review decisions.

## API Contract

Read APIs:

- GET `/api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}/checker-runs`
- GET `/api/v1/checker-runs/{checker_run_id}`

Checker read and trigger APIs use the existing external Flow authentication boundary. Workstream verifies Flow-issued tokens, resolves actor context, and applies object-level authorization. Chunk 6 must not introduce Workstream-owned login, password, session, or API key auth.

Public APIs must not create, update, or delete durable checker results.

Durable `CheckerRun` and `CheckerResult` records are written only by Workstream-owned checker services using server-derived checker output. External Flow actors may request allowed pre-submit checks or authorized retry triggers in later chunks, but they must never provide result status, severity, `blocks_review`, metadata, routing recommendation, locked policy context, or pass/fail payloads.

Any future trigger endpoint creates only a run request. The checker service computes and persists all results.

Write behavior is internal service/repository only in Chunk 6. Chunk 7 and Chunk 9 can expose controlled trigger paths that still do not accept caller-supplied result payloads.

## Visibility Rules

Read authorization must be object-scoped, not role-only.

- workers can read worker-visible checker output only for submissions on tasks assigned to them
- project managers can read operational checker output only for projects they manage
- admins can read operational checker output globally
- reviewers can read checker output only after the submission is assigned to them for review in later review work
- auditors can read according to the audit/read-only policy, but cannot see worker-hidden sensitive metadata unless explicitly allowed by audit policy

Worker responses include only result rows where `worker_visible = true`. For hidden operational results, worker responses may expose aggregate counts but must not expose checker id, metadata, internal rule ids, logs, stack traces, or unsafe evidence refs.

Worker-visible responses are built from sanitized worker-facing fields, not raw checker metadata. They may include:

- checker name
- status
- severity
- `worker_message`
- `worker_suggested_fix`
- safe `worker_evidence_refs`

Raw `metadata`, internal rule IDs, stack traces, hidden-test details, reviewer-simulation prompts, private storage paths, secrets, and security heuristics are never returned to workers.

Project managers and admins can see operational metadata.

## Manual And Retry Audit Rules

`manual_checker_trigger` and `retry` trigger sources require:

- `triggered_by`
- Flow auth subject
- Flow auth issuer
- auth source
- reason
- `audit_event_id`

System-triggered runs use a Workstream service principal. Manual runs must be attributable to an authorized admin or project manager and must not overwrite prior checker results.

## Immutability Rules

Checker results are append-only after persistence. No public API can update or delete checker results.

Internal services may only create new runs/results or transition a run status through allowed states. Checker runs may update only lifecycle fields before terminal status: `status`, counts, `started_at`, `completed_at`, and `failure_message`. After `completed` or `failed`, run records are immutable except for explicit audited retry records in later chunks. Corrections require a new checker run linked to the prior run.

## Description

Describe the work to be done.

## Output Notes

Describe task-specific work in human terms when the description needs more

forbidden artifacts are defined by the active project
`SubmissionArtifactPolicy` and locked project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy`, not by
task fields.

## Rejection Criteria

screening. Task creators do not provide submission artifact requirement fields
directly.

- effective project submission artifact policy id:
- effective project submission artifact policy hash:
- project pre-submit checker policy id:
- project pre-submit checker bundle hash:

creators do not provide award fields directly.

# Chunk 7: Checker Runner And Registry

## Purpose

Chunk 7 turns the checker contract into a working backend slice.

Workstream now has a checker module that can:

- return non-authoritative pre-submit feedback before a packet is finalized
- run registered structural checkers against a real locked submission
- persist durable `checker_runs` and `checker_results`
- validate checker policy names against the registry
- expose checker runs/results through authenticated backend APIs
- keep worker-visible checker output separate from internal metadata

This is still not the automatic pre-review gate. Chunk 9 owns automatic transition into `REVIEW_PENDING` or checker-caused `needs_revision`.

## Scope

- `checker_runs` and `checker_results` migration
- SQLAlchemy checker models
- checker schemas
- checker repository
- checker service
- checker API router
- checker registry
- pre-submit static feedback path
- first structural checkers:
  - `check_submission_packet`
  - `check_policy_context_present`
  - `check_artifact_manifest_integrity`
  - `check_evidence_references_present`
- canonical artifact manifest hash helper
- real Postgres-backed API and migration tests

## Non-Scope

- automatic checker trigger after submission locking
- moving tasks into `REVIEW_PENDING`
- creating human review decision records
- creating contribution, payment, or reputation records
- product frontend pages
- reviewer object-level checker visibility before review assignment exists
- external checker adapters
- Celery or distributed worker execution

## API Contract

Pre-submit feedback:

```text
POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/submission-precheck
```

This endpoint accepts a draft `SubmissionCreate` payload wrapped in a pre-submit request body. It returns immediate feedback for the UI submission flow.

Pre-submit feedback is not authoritative review-gate proof and does not create durable `checker_runs`. The response uses `eligible_to_submit` and `would_block_if_submitted` language so the UI does not confuse draft feedback with post-submit review gating.

Durable post-submit checker run:

```text
POST /api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}/checker-runs
```

This endpoint triggers the v0.1 authorized manual checker path for internal checker execution. It accepts only a trigger reason. It does not accept checker status, severity, routing, result, metadata, or pass/fail fields from the caller.

Checker read APIs:

```text
GET /api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}/checker-runs
GET /api/v1/checker-runs/{checker_run_id}
```

Project managers and admins can see internal result messages and metadata. Assigned workers can only see worker-visible result rows and sanitized worker-facing fields.

Reviewer checker visibility is deferred until reviewer assignment/routing exists. Reviewers should eventually see checker proof for packets assigned to them, but Chunk 7 does not grant broad reviewer read access without an object-level review assignment.

## Registry Contract

Checker policy names must match registered checker names.

If a locked checker policy references an unknown checker, Workstream rejects durable checker execution with a validation error and does not write fake checker results.

The initial registered checker names are:

- `check_submission_packet`
- `check_policy_context_present`
- `check_artifact_manifest_integrity`
- `check_evidence_references_present`

## Runner Behavior

The runner loads:

- task
- latest locked submission by id
- locked checker policy
- locked guide and policy versions already stamped on the submission
- package hash
- artifact hash manifest
- actor audit context from the verified Flow token

The checker interface is async-first. Chunk 7 can complete the first structural checker run inside the request path because the built-in checks are local and fast. Background execution, retries, and distributed worker isolation stay deferred until the pre-review gate and later runner hardening.

It creates one current checker run per submission. A later manual run supersedes the previous current run for that submission and increments `attempt_number`.

Authorized manual checker triggers create an append-only audit event and link it from `checker_runs.audit_event_id`.

For a clean submission, the run records:

- `status = completed`
- `routing_recommendation = allow_review`
- `outcome_source = none`

`routing_recommendation` is a checker routing field, not a human review decision. It must not be normalized to `accept`, because a checker can only recommend that the packet is ready for human review. Human review decisions remain only `accept`, `needs_revision`, and `reject`.

For worker-fixable blocking structural failures, the run records:

- `status = completed`
- `routing_recommendation = needs_revision`
- `outcome_source = auto_checker`

Chunk 7 records the recommendation only. Chunk 9 applies the lifecycle transition.

## Artifact Manifest Hash

The artifact manifest hash uses SHA-256 over canonical UTF-8 JSON:

- preserve `artifact`, `hash`, `size_bytes`, and `notes`
- sort entries by `artifact` and `hash`
- sort keys inside JSON objects
- use compact JSON separators
- reject duplicate artifact names

Malformed artifact manifests become persisted checker failures in durable post-submit runs.

## Security Boundary

Workstream still verifies external Flow authentication tokens. Chunk 7 does not add Workstream-owned login, signup, passwords, auth sessions, or API keys.

Only Workstream-owned checker code writes durable checker results. API callers can trigger an allowed run path, but they cannot supply result payloads.

Worker responses must not expose:

- raw checker metadata
- internal messages
- stack traces
- private object paths
- hidden-test details
- reviewer simulation prompts
- secrets or security heuristics

## Conditions Of Satisfaction

- Alembic upgrade/downgrade creates and removes checker tables
- checker ORM models are registered in Alembic metadata
- partial unique index allows one current run per submission
- pre-submit check returns feedback without durable checker rows
- durable checker run works through real authenticated API calls
- `check_submission_packet` runs against real submission data
- duplicate artifact manifests persist worker-visible checker failures
- unknown policy checker names block execution before fake results are written
- assigned worker reads are sanitized
- authorized manual checker triggers are linked to audit events
- non-latest submissions cannot receive new checker runs
- unassigned workers cannot read or precheck another worker's task
- caller-supplied fake checker result payloads are rejected by schemas
- tests use real Postgres-backed API flows, not monkeypatch-only unit tests

## Verification

Run from `backend/` against local Postgres:

```bash
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_checkers.py -q
```

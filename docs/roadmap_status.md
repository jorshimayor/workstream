- Chunk 9 automatic pre-review gate with pre-submit intake blocking, internal `task_setup_blocked`, trusted checker retry, and worker redaction.
- Chunk 10 checker trial with the expanded real API sample matrix, failure catalog, false-positive notes, missing-checker notes, and internal verifier evidence.
- Week 2 real HTTP API drill through Flow-token auth, project/guide/task/submission lifecycle, pre-submit checks, automatic checker runs, `pre_submission_checker_failed` intake failures, worker redaction, internal `task_setup_blocked`, and trusted checker retry.

## Review Tracks Closed

- Product strategy.
- Architecture.
- Systems architecture.
- Operations and review workflow.
- Process-pattern baseline.
- Adversarial quality.
- Chunk 9 pre-review gate internal verifier pass.
- Chunk 10 checker trial internal verifier pass.

## Ready For Week 3

- Review queue scope can start from `review_pending` tasks that already passed internal checkers.
- Reviewer access must be object-level and tied to assigned review work; broad reviewer checker-run access is still intentionally deferred.
- Week 3 must keep review decisions canonical: `accept`, `needs_revision`, and `reject`.
- `needs_revision` from human review must carry `outcome_source = human_review` and a review decision id; checker-caused `needs_revision` keeps `outcome_source = auto_checker`.
- Review findings, revision replay, and reviewer-quality metrics are the next backend contracts to lock.

## Pending Before Pilot

- Create the first pilot project guide from the template.
- Create the first 5 pilot task records.
- Confirm who owns product, engineering, review, operations, and payment reconciliation during the first build cycle.
- Confirm the first v0.1 project guide uses the locked guide fields, task contract fields, evidence IDs, and contribution record flow.

## Backend API Contract Drill

Run from the backend directory against local Postgres:

```bash
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test .venv/bin/python scripts/api_contract_e2e.py
```

The script runs migrations forward and exercises:

`Project -> Guide -> Task -> Screening -> Ready -> Claim -> Start -> Submit -> Lock submission`

## Week 2 Real API Drill

Run from the backend directory against local Postgres:

```bash
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test .venv/bin/python scripts/week2_api_e2e.py
```

The script starts a real local API server, issues local Flow-compatible tokens,
runs migrations forward, and exercises:

`Project -> Guide -> Task -> Screening -> Ready -> Claim -> Start -> Pre-submit checks -> pre_submission_checker_failed | Submit -> Lock submission -> evaluation_pending -> review_pending | checker_caused_revision -> needs_revision -> fixed_resubmission -> evaluation_pending -> review_pending | internal task_setup_blocked -> trusted checker retry`

It also proves older submissions remain immutable, non-owning worker calls create
no task-side effects, malicious internal fields are rejected before persistence,
and checker-caused `needs_revision` creates no human review decision.

## Deterministic Week 2 Closeout Gate

The Week 2 closeout gate is deterministic and must fail on contract drift.

Required invariants:

- Real API drills run only against local `postgresql+asyncpg://` test databases named `workstream_test` or `test_workstream` unless an explicit write-risk override is supplied.
- Pre-submit checker responses are authoritative for submission intake and must not create submissions, checker runs, or lifecycle transitions when blocking failures exist.
- Missing or unexpected pre-submit checker names fail the drill.
- Missing or unexpected durable checker names fail the drill.
- Submission locking returns `locked_at`, locks evidence rows, and is idempotent.
- Automatic checker-run creation, checker terminal status, and task-status transitions are polled because execution is async-first.
- Checker-run list visibility is checked for project manager, assigned worker, unassigned worker, and reviewer roles.
- Trusted checker retry proves attempt ordering, supersession, and current-run flags.
- Postgres invariants are checked after the real API flows for locked guide/policy context, evidence locks, checker results, checker counters, current-run uniqueness, and gate audit events.

Week 2 closeout validation is not only this script. The full gate is:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check app tests scripts
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test .venv/bin/python scripts/api_contract_e2e.py
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test .venv/bin/python scripts/week2_api_e2e.py
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_checkers.py tests/test_tasks.py -q
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://workstream:workstream@localhost:5433/workstream_test .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/docstr-coverage --config .docstr.yaml
```

The closeout also requires stale wording scan, Markdown link check, and internal verifier evidence before PR.

## Operating Rule

No roadmap item is considered closed until it is represented in one of:

- product spec
- architecture spec
- operation workflow
- template
- checker rule
- decision record
- review closure

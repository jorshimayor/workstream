# Authorization Service Operations

## Purpose

This runbook assigns ownership and stop conditions for the staged WS-AUTH-001
authorization rollout. The verified-token configuration and evidence commands
are executable contracts. Canonical actor resolution, actor-self authorization,
one-time bootstrap, and administrative grant APIs are active through AUTH-08;
later actor lifecycle and project-grant sections remain staged until their
owning implementation chunks.

## Ownership

| Area | Primary owner | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Issuer/audience/algorithm configuration | Platform security | Approved non-secret configuration inventory and verifier tests. |
| JWKS endpoint, cache, and rotation | Platform security/on-call | Rotation drill, cache bounds, outage behavior, alerts. |
| Introspection/revocation policy | Platform security | Approved mode, endpoint trust policy, timeout/failure proof. |
| First Access Administrator bootstrap | Restricted deployment operator | Dry-run, target verification, one-time result, authority event. |
| Legacy actor classification | Data migration owner plus security reviewer | Versioned manifest, live-row digest, checksum, dry-run report. |
| Actor/grant administration | Access Administrator | Supported API/command, reason, idempotency, evidence. |
| Project contributor grants | Covered Project Manager | Exact-project target and privacy-bounded candidate lookup. |
| Recovery operations | Operator or covered Project Manager as specified | Matched permission, reason, resource scope, immutable evidence. |
| Rollout and rollback | Release owner | Migration round trip, compatibility inventory, rollback stop conditions. |
| Live authorization proof | Release owner plus security/QA | API-visible drill with redacted committed evidence. |

| `WORKSTREAM_API_ADMIN_MUTATION_RATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` | Integer `1..3600` | `60` |

Secrets, private keys, bearer tokens, full claims, and raw JWKS documents must
not appear in committed configuration or evidence.

Verified issuer and `sub` identity anchors are each limited to 200 characters
across the verifier, canonical registry, compatibility storage, audit, and
checker provenance. Development issuer and subject settings use the same bound.
Oversized values fail verification or configuration before actor persistence.

Verification evidence:

```bash
tmp_venv="$(mktemp -d)"
python3 -m venv "$tmp_venv"
"$tmp_venv/bin/python" -m pip install -e ./backend
"$tmp_venv/bin/python" -c 'import jwt, cryptography, httpx'
"$tmp_venv/bin/python" -m pip check
rm -rf "$tmp_venv"

cd backend
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_auth.py tests/test_config.py
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check app tests scripts

python3 scripts/check_loop_memory_state.py
git diff --check
```

During the compatibility period, `/api/v1/auth/me` uses only the verified
issuer/subject plus bounded legacy roles. It does not copy issuer email or
display name into actor storage or responses, so both response fields remain
`null`. Consumers must not treat token identity metadata or legacy workflow
eligibility as profile or authorization truth. Human-owned display data is
written only through `PATCH /api/v1/actors/me`.

## Request And Error Context

Clients may send one `X-Request-ID` and one `X-Correlation-ID`. Each supplied
value must be a canonical lowercase, hyphenated, non-nil RFC 9562 UUID using the
RFC variant and version 1 through 8. A missing request ID is generated as
UUIDv4; a missing correlation ID reuses the effective request ID. Duplicate,
comma-joined, malformed, non-ASCII, nil, or unsupported-version values stop
before route/dependency execution with HTTP 400 `invalid_request`. That response
uses one newly generated UUIDv4 for both safe headers and never reflects the
rejected bytes.

Every success and error response returns the effective IDs in
`X-Request-ID` and `X-Correlation-ID`. Application-supplied response values for
those headers are overwritten. Status, content length, duplicate unrelated
headers, `WWW-Authenticate`, `Retry-After`, streaming chunks, and background
work remain unchanged.

Errors add this canonical object while retaining the existing top-level
`detail` or domain `code/details` compatibility fields:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": {},
    "correlation_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
    "retryable": false
  }
}
```

The authentication boundary uses `missing_token`, `invalid_token`,
`identity_verification_unavailable`, and `unsupported_subject_kind` for their
exact branches. Verification/registry unavailability is retryable; invalid
credentials, unsupported kinds, validation, permission, not-found, conflict,
and internal application errors are not. The canonical nested validation
summary is capped at 20 errors with type/location evidence only. Existing
sanitized validator messages remain solely in the bounded compatibility
`detail` list.

Use the correlation ID to join operator evidence. Never add bearer tokens,
claims, subjects, emails, SQL, provider bodies, exception text, or secrets to
responses or logs. AUTH-04A does not activate rate controls, grant APIs, or new
product authority; those remain owned by later separately reviewed chunks.

## Canonical Actor Resolution

Every protected human request resolves the exact verified `(issuer, subject)`
through one `ActorIdentityLink` to one local `ActorProfile`. The first valid
human access consumes the PostgreSQL first-access rate control, then creates the
profile, identity link, `ActorProfileProvisioned`, and `ActorIdentityLinked`
evidence in one transaction. Concurrent allowed first-access requests cannot
leave duplicate profiles, links, or evidence. Rate-limited requests may still
receive HTTP 429 before identity serialization.

`GET /api/v1/actors/me` returns the caller's privacy-bounded Contributor-domain
profile plus sorted active administrative role names as a non-authoritative
self projection; project grants remain empty until AUTH-10. `PATCH /api/v1/actors/me` accepts
only `display_name` and `contact_email`; token roles, issuer metadata, actor
kind, status, grants, and lifecycle fields are not writable there. Suspended
profiles remain readable for support, but suspended or deactivated profiles
cannot be mutated or use legacy product routes.

Unknown services require later manual provisioning and are denied without a
write. Agent and Space subjects are denied without a write. Operators must not
convert token roles, email shape, subject shape, or old typed profiles into
actor kind or authority.

A provisioned service ActorProfile is the stable Workstream principal, similar
to a Kubernetes ServiceAccount. Its immutable `service_identity` is one of the
closed registered internal services; its identity link separately stores the
configured issuer and opaque subject used to verify credentials. Operators must
never use display name, email, subject syntax, token role, or adapter provenance
as the service identity.

Service authority is not administered as database assignment rows. The exact
service-to-ActionId matrix is reviewed static code. Services receive no
Contributor domain, AdminRoleGrant, or ProjectRoleGrant, and every artifact
action remains unavailable until its owning WS-ART feature activates the
resource facts and guards. A clean database may start without provisioned
services; an unprovisioned or mismatched service request fails closed.

### Existing Service Identity Mapping Custody

This procedure applies only when pre-`0023` service ActorProfiles exist. The
data-migration owner prepares a private draft containing the exact existing
ActorProfile ID, issuer, opaque subject, and proposed fixed service identity for
each row. A security reviewer confirms every choice from authoritative service
ownership records. Neither the tool nor an operator may infer a value from
subject syntax, email, display name, token role, or adapter provenance.

Run the supported mapping tool first in dry-run mode against the exact target
database and draft, then generate the database-bound envelope. The output must
be a regular non-symlink file owned by the invoking operator with mode `0600` in
an access-controlled directory outside the main checkout, every linked
worktree, and shared Git metadata. Both draft and envelope use one strict,
key-sorted compact JSON object followed by exactly one newline; boolean,
floating-point, pretty-printed, reordered, or otherwise noncanonical schema
input is rejected. Verify the envelope against the unchanged target database
before migration. Zero existing service rows require no file; otherwise the
envelope must cover exactly every existing service row and may select any
unique subset of the seven closed identities.

Using a deployment-secret environment for `WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL`, the
supported sequence is:

```bash
chmod 600 /secure/workstream/service-identity-draft-v1.json
.venv/bin/python scripts/service_actor_identity_mapping.py validate \
  --draft /secure/workstream/service-identity-draft-v1.json
.venv/bin/python scripts/service_actor_identity_mapping.py bind \
  --draft /secure/workstream/service-identity-draft-v1.json \
  --output /secure/workstream/service-identity-envelope-v1.json
chmod 600 /secure/workstream/service-identity-envelope-v1.json
.venv/bin/python scripts/service_actor_identity_mapping.py verify \
  --envelope /secure/workstream/service-identity-envelope-v1.json
```

`validate` and `verify` never modify the database. `bind` writes only the
confidential canonical envelope and refuses an existing output path. The tool
prints stable codes, bounded counts, and non-secret digests only.

Inject `WORKSTREAM_SERVICE_ACTOR_IDENTITY_MAPPING_FILE` through the deployment
secret runner only in the migration process environment immediately before
`alembic upgrade head`. Do not place the path or file content in interactive
shell history, CI logs, application configuration, containers, images, tickets,
or repository files. Remove the injection after the migration. Stable failures
expose only a code and bounded count; inspect the private tool report locally
rather than adding issuer subjects to logs.

After database verification, retain the reviewed change record plus the
non-secret source, manifest, envelope, and database-binding digests stored by
the migration. PostgreSQL format constraints and update/delete/truncate guards
make that singleton evidence immutable. Securely delete the confidential draft
and bound envelope under the operator's storage policy. If any existing service
cannot truthfully map to the fixed registry, stop the deployment on the prior
release and open a separately reviewed remediation; do not delete history,
guess a mapping, or use manual SQL.

The [approved AUTH-06 chunk contract](../.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-AUTH-001-workstream-authorization-service/chunks/WS-AUTH-001-06-canonical-actor-profile.md)
records the exact deprecated compatibility identifier. That temporary,
enumerated intake route writes only `LegacyWorkflowEligibility` and cannot
create a grant or change a canonical profile. Its direct compatibility
consumers are assigned-submitter claim, assigned-submitter start, and submission
intake. Operator start override does not use the bridge. AUTH-13 removes the
claim and start consumers; AUTH-14 removes the final submission consumer,
compatibility route, and adapter.

## PostgreSQL Rate Controls

First human access now uses the AUTH-04B PostgreSQL control. Future
authority-management mutations attach their separately configured control in
their owning chunks. Every replica must use the same secret and settings.
Missing secret or database access fails first access closed with retryable HTTP
503; an exhausted window returns retryable HTTP 429 with an integer
`Retry-After`. Existing exact identity links do not consume first-access
capacity.

Generate the secret outside the repository and store it in the deployment
secret manager:

```bash
python3 -c 'import base64,secrets; print(base64.b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).decode())'
```

Counters store only the server-owned scope and an HMAC-SHA256 digest of the
verified issuer/subject. They do not store raw identity, actor, token, claim,
role, email, or network values. Consumption uses database time and commits in
an independent session before the protected mutation may continue or return
429, so downstream rollback does not restore allowance.

Secret rotation intentionally creates a new digest space. Before rotating:

1. Quiesce every protected write for at least the largest effective
   pre-rotation window configured on any replica.
2. Rotate every replica while writes remain quiesced; mixed-secret replicas
   must not serve protected writes.
3. Delete only rows expired by PostgreSQL time:

```sql
DELETE FROM api_rate_control_counters
WHERE window_expires_at <= statement_timestamp();
```

4. Confirm all replicas use the new secret, then resume protected writes.

Runtime consumption opportunistically deletes at most 100 expired other rows.
On idle systems, operators may run the same expired-only SQL cleanup. Never
delete active rows to recover capacity, and never downgrade migration `0017`
while the table is nonempty; the guarded downgrade takes an exclusive table
lock, refuses, and rolls back. Quiesce every protected write before attempting
the downgrade so waiting writers cannot resume against a removed table.

## JWKS Rotation And Outage

Rotation procedure:

1. Confirm the new key is published by the configured issuer over trusted
   HTTPS.
2. Verify algorithm and key-use constraints.
3. Exercise unknown-key refresh once; do not create refresh loops.
4. Verify both old and new unexpired tokens only during the issuer's approved
   overlap.
5. Confirm cache, refresh-success, and refresh-failure metrics use bounded
   labels.
6. Remove the retired key according to issuer policy and repeat denial tests.

During an outage, cached keys may be used only inside the configured safe
window. Once verification cannot be established, protected requests fail
closed. Operators must not switch to an unpinned algorithm, shared production
HMAC secret, development verifier, unsigned token, or unverified claim parsing.

## Introspection And Revocation Mode

Production must select an explicit mode:

- disabled only with documented issuer revocation/short-lifetime evidence;
- required bearer-token introspection only to a separately configured HTTPS
  endpoint with OAuth client-secret Basic authentication, no redirects or
  environment proxies, and strict time/response bounds.

Required introspection responses contain `active=true`, `iss`, `sub`, `aud`,
and `jti`; every identity value must match the already signature-verified
token. Introspection cannot provide or replace identity, kind, scope, roles, or
grants. Identifier-only introspection is not supported in this chunk. Platform
security owns the client ID/secret, rotation, and revocation procedure.

JWKS and introspection use separate clients and policies. Bearer tokens never
reach JWKS endpoints, redirect targets, logs, traces, errors, or audit events.
An introspection outage fails according to the approved mode; it cannot silently
degrade to token-role authority.

## Bootstrap Custody

Bootstrap is a restricted local management operation.

Before execution:

- verify the target is the intended active human profile and identity link;
- verify the environment and database;
- capture a redacted dry-run result;
- confirm the one-time bootstrap has not already completed;
- confirm the deployment operator has restricted environment access;
- confirm audit and database-time behavior are available.

Run the supported command from the backend with the target's canonical UUID:

```bash
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL='<target async Postgres URL>' \
  .venv/bin/python -m scripts.bootstrap_access_administrator \
  --actor-profile-id '<canonical actor UUID>' --dry-run

WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL='<target async Postgres URL>' \
  .venv/bin/python -m scripts.bootstrap_access_administrator \
  --actor-profile-id '<canonical actor UUID>' --execute
```

Dry-run is read-only and does not promise later success. Execution locks
`AuthorityControl(id = 1) FOR UPDATE`, revalidates the active human target,
then commits exactly one initial grant, completed control transition, and
success event. Exit code `0` is eligible/success, `2` is invalid or ineligible,
`3` is already bootstrapped/concurrent loser, and `1` is infrastructure
failure. Preserve the bounded JSON result and correlated authority evidence;
never add issuer, subject, email, display name, token, or database URL.

If execution returns `1`, leave bootstrap custody with the deployment operator,
verify transaction rollback and database availability, and retry the same
supported command. Later or concurrent attempts return the stable audited
conflict and must not be repaired by editing the control or grant tables.

Never bootstrap through public HTTP, direct SQL, a shared secret, or a
fabricated human/system role.

## Legacy Actor Classification

Non-empty legacy registries require the supported classification tool and a
versioned JSON manifest. Each entry binds the exact legacy actor ID, issuer,
opaque subject, and subject kind.

Platform security owns the manifest and envelope. Both files contain
confidential identity-linking evidence even though the command report is
redacted. Store them in an environment-specific owner-only directory outside
the repository, every linked worktree, and the Git common directory. Do not
attach either file to tickets, CI logs, PRs, or engineering-loop evidence.

Manifest schema version 1 has exactly this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "classifications": [
    {
      "actor_id": "00000000-0000-5000-8000-000000000000",
      "issuer": "https://issuer.example.invalid",
      "subject": "opaque-subject-from-the-legacy-row",
      "subject_kind": "human"
    }
  ]
}
```

`subject_kind` is only `human` or `service`. The actor ID must be the canonical
UUIDv5 derived by the existing registry from the byte-exact HTTPS issuer and
case-sensitive opaque subject. Operators must classify from authoritative
issuer records; email, subject syntax, token roles, profile rows, and manual SQL
are not classification evidence.

The tool must:

- support dry-run;
- reject unknown fields/kinds, duplicates, missing rows, extra rows, stale
  rows, mismatched issuer/subject, invalid UUIDs, and ambiguous classification;
- compute a complete live-row digest and manifest checksum;
- bind evidence to a non-secret database/environment identifier;
- write no grants;
- emit a bounded remediation report.

Prepare a restricted directory and validate without writing an envelope:

```bash
cd backend
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL='<target async Postgres URL>' \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/legacy_actor_classification.py \
  --manifest /secure/workstream/prod/legacy-actor-manifest-v1.json
```

Dry-run is the default. An empty registry needs no manifest and returns an
explicit empty proof. A non-empty registry without a manifest fails closed. The
JSON report contains only row count, mode, empty status, checksums, and the
non-secret database binding; stderr uses stable error codes and does not render
identity values, paths, database names, or connection URLs.

After the dry-run report is reviewed, export one write-once envelope:

```bash
cd backend
WORKSTREAM_DATABASE_URL='<target async Postgres URL>' \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/legacy_actor_classification.py \
  --manifest /secure/workstream/prod/legacy-actor-manifest-v1.json \
  --output /secure/workstream/prod/legacy-actor-classification-v1.json \
  --generated-at 2026-07-13T12:30:00Z
```

`--generated-at` is an explicit UTC RFC3339 second so the same reviewed inputs
produce byte-identical evidence. Export writes mode `0600` through a
crash-safe, atomic no-overwrite publish. Repeating the exact command is
idempotent only when the existing regular file has identical bytes and private
permissions. A different existing file, symlink, relative path, repository
path, or Git-directory path fails closed.

The envelope contains schema version, sorted classifications, live source-row
digest, canonical manifest digest, generated-at, database binding, and a digest
over the complete envelope. The binding hashes PostgreSQL database name and
database OID. It is a non-secret same-cluster wrong-database guard, not a
globally unique deployment identity. A clone, restore, or database recreation
requires a fresh dry run and envelope even when the human environment label is
unchanged.

The canonical actor-schema migration locates this envelope only through:

```bash
export WORKSTREAM_LEGACY_ACTOR_CLASSIFICATION_FILE=/secure/workstream/prod/legacy-actor-classification-v1.json
```

Set the variable only on the reviewed AUTH-06 migration runner. The migration
loads the strict envelope, recomputes the complete live row-set digest and
database binding inside its transaction, and aborts on checksum, TOCTOU,
missing/extra row, identity, or binding mismatch. The envelope never creates
grants and is not a supported ad hoc migration path.

On validation failure, correct the authoritative manifest or target database,
rerun dry-run, and export to a new secure path when the evidence bytes change.
Never edit an envelope or bypass the failure with SQL.

Deploy AUTH-06 only in a quiesced maintenance window after the dry-run report
and envelope have been reviewed:

1. Drain in-flight API requests and jobs.
2. Stop every old-version API replica and asynchronous writer.
3. Run the migration from the reviewed AUTH-06 release artifact.
4. Start only replicas and jobs containing the matching AUTH-06 code.
5. Complete the checks below before resuming traffic.

```bash
cd backend
export WORKSTREAM_LEGACY_ACTOR_CLASSIFICATION_FILE=/secure/workstream/prod/legacy-actor-classification-v1.json
.venv/bin/alembic upgrade 0020_canonical_actor_profile
```

Verify one durable migration-state row before serving traffic. Record only the
schema version, classified count, and checksums; do not export identity rows:

```sql
select schema_version, classified_count, source_row_set_sha256,
       manifest_sha256, envelope_sha256, migrated_at
from actor_profile_migration_state where id = 1;

select
  (select count(*) from actor_profiles) as profile_count,
  (select count(*) from actor_identity_links) as identity_link_count,
  not exists (
    select 1 from actor_profiles p
    full join actor_identity_links l on l.actor_profile_id = p.id
    where p.id is null or l.id is null
  ) as exact_one_link_per_profile,
  to_regclass('public.admin_role_grants') is null as no_admin_grant_table,
  to_regclass('public.project_role_grants') is null as no_project_grant_table;
```

Confirm every canonical profile has exactly one identity link, the classified
count matches the reviewed report, and no grants were created by the migration.
Retain the manifest and envelope only through verification and the approved
rollback window. Then delete both identity-bearing files from operator storage
and retain only the bounded report and durable checksum record.

Rollback to `0019_authority_idempotency` uses the same quiescence sequence: drain
requests and jobs, stop all AUTH-06 writers, run the downgrade, deploy only the
matching pre-AUTH-06 code, verify, and then resume traffic. The downgrade is
envelope-independent because its required state is in PostgreSQL. It refuses
while any profile is suspended or any identity link is revoked; those states
may be repaired only through their reviewed lifecycle operations, never direct
SQL. Deactivation is terminal: if any actor is deactivated, downgrade is
unavailable and operators must recover forward on AUTH-06. A non-empty registry
restored to 0019 cannot be upgraded again from deleted evidence: run the
classification tool against the exact restored rows and obtain a newly reviewed
envelope. The migration never guesses a subject kind or bypasses this
fresh-evidence requirement.

Run the exact rollback only after those checks pass:

```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/alembic downgrade 0019_authority_idempotency
```

Rollback restores every canonical identity to legacy identity storage and
copies the current canonical `display_name` and `contact_email`, including
`null`, into the restored row. This prevents a cleared canonical contact email
from being resurrected by pre-AUTH-06 code. Because canonical migration does
not import legacy display fields, rollback intentionally scrubs retained legacy
display data unless it was set through `PATCH /api/v1/actors/me` after AUTH-06.

## Staged Rollout

For each chunk:

1. Confirm allowed files and stop conditions.
2. Run focused tests plus the full backend suite/API drill required by the
   contract.
3. Run migration upgrade, downgrade-one, and re-upgrade where applicable.
4. Confirm the temporary compatibility allowlist only shrinks.
5. Run required internal reviewers and repair valid findings.
6. Publish one chunk-sized PR and stop for human merge approval.
7. Update post-merge memory before activating the next chunk.

Do not cut over a resource family until its local actor, grant, permission,
resource loader, lifecycle guards, negative tests, and evidence path exist.

### Catalogue And Action-Evidence Staging

The catalogue contains exactly 74 PermissionIds and 65 ActionIds after AUTH-09A.
The two AUTH-07B actor-self actions and seven AUTH-08 administrative actions are
active; the other 56 entries remain planned and non-executable. Planned entries
contain only action, permission, owner, and availability and must not receive
deployment configuration, resource facts, or guards. The separate fixed
service-action matrix is static candidate policy, not action activation.
Startup validation failure is a release blocker, not a reason to relax
catalogue checks.

Migration `0021` preserves historical audit rows with null `action_id`. Inspect
non-null action evidence only by bounded ActionId, request/correlation IDs, and
resource references; do not export event payloads or actor identity-link data
for routine diagnosis. Every action must carry its catalogue-mapped PermissionId,
and every permission added after migration `0018` must carry one of its mapped
actions. Planned actions can record bounded denial evidence but cannot record an
allowed decision through the typed writer.

The historical permission set remains exactly 49 values. The post-`0020` set
contains exactly 25 values, including `review.queue.override`; do not derive
historical status from identifier prefixes. All submission/review rows remain
planned. Initial and revision submission share `submission.create`, and no
revision-specific permission or preparation action exists.

Review code must consume the request-scoped public
`AuthorizationService.require(action_id, typed_resource_context)` boundary.
The service's bound caller-owned `AsyncSession` is the only transaction source;
the method accepts no session or `uow` argument. Review code must not query
grants, import AUTH persistence, select raw
PermissionIds, or implement permission unions. Artifact recovery remains the
ART-owned `artifact.verification_job.retry` action through
`ArtifactOperatorRecoveryPort`; shared outbox dispatch/retry remains outside
REV ownership.

Downgrade is allowed only while every action ID remains null and no permission
outside migration `0018`'s historical 49-value set exists in the decision,
target-reference, or invalidation-reference fields. The migration takes an
exclusive audit-table lock before these checks and keeps it through destructive
DDL. If any forward evidence exists, stop and recover forward rather than
discarding it.

Canonical actor self-read/self-update and the seven AUTH-08 administrative
actions are active. Project capability context waits for AUTH-10 exact-project
grants and canonical project composition.

## Actor Self Decision Operations

`GET /api/v1/actors/me` declares `actor.profile.read_self`; it permits an
active identity link with an active or suspended human actor and commits only
the bounded read-decision evidence after authorization. `PATCH
/api/v1/actors/me` declares `actor.profile.update_self`; it locks the exact
identity link first and actor profile second, rechecks current state, mutates
only `display_name` or `contact_email`, and commits mutation plus allow evidence
once. The authorization kernel never commits or rolls back.

Self routes return explicit 403 errors because the caller owns the target:
`identity_link_revoked`, then `actor_deactivated`, then `actor_suspended` for an
update. A correction to lifecycle state takes effect on the next request; no
decision cache survives a request. Token role changes do not affect either
self action. Unknown and planned actions appear publicly only as
`permission_not_granted`.

For diagnosis, query authority-domain `authorization_decision` rows by bounded
request/correlation ID and exact ActionId. Confirm the mapped PermissionId,
actor-profile resource reference, `allowed` fact, and denial code. Do not log or
export issuer subjects, bearer tokens, display names, contact emails, or token
roles. If a denied PATCH occurs, the route transaction is rolled back and the
same frozen denial is committed from a clean transaction; a changed decision
ID or concurrent display-field mutation is an incident signal.

## Administrative Authority Operations

AUTH-08 activates permission and administrative-role definition reads, scoped
administrative-grant collection and actor-history reads, and administrative
grant issue/revoke. Access Administrator is the only role that can issue or
revoke. Audit Authority is read-only and sees only the system or exact-project
scope covered by its current grant; filtering occurs before totals and cursors.
Requested target role/scope is mutation data, never caller authority.

Each protected route owns one caller-session transaction. A successful read,
exact replay, issue, or revoke commits its decision evidence and advances the
caller's `ActorProfile.last_seen_at` and `ActorIdentityLink.last_verified_at`
using database time. Issue/revoke additionally commit business state,
idempotency completion, success evidence, and linked invalidation together.
Success, invalidation, mismatch, and post-allow conflict evidence derive their
request/correlation IDs from the exact authorization decision; feature callers
cannot override them.
The decision resource-context digest binds role, scope, target, and existing
idempotency-record disposition. Issue/revoke recomputes the reason digest before
any state or evidence write.
The shared authorization dependency never commits an open feature transaction;
it rolls back anything the route forgot to commit.

If route-owned persistence or decision evidence fails, roll back the entire
unit and return the bounded retryable `503 service_unavailable` envelope. Do
not report a mutation as successful, retain a pending idempotency result, or
advance verification timestamps. A retry uses the same idempotency key. Exact
replays reauthorize current caller authority and canonical resource state before
returning the stored response; mismatches commit only bounded denial evidence
from a clean transaction.

## Rollback

Rollback stops rather than bypasses authorization. A deployment may roll back
only to the preceding reviewed chunk state and compatible schema revision.

Stop rollout when:

- issuer behavior would require trusting a token role/unverified claim;
- classification requires guessing subject kind;
- a second canonical actor/verifier/authorization path appears necessary;
- authority state and evidence cannot commit atomically;
- final-administrator safety depends on an unlocked count;
- an intermediate release cannot execute the established intake lifecycle;
- tests, CI, privacy, or auth defaults would need weakening.

Do not restore deleted authority through direct SQL or re-enable an obsolete
token-role path outside its reviewed compatibility owner.

## Recovery Permission Inventory

| Operation | Authority | Required controls |
|---|---|---|
| Normal covered task/setup repair | Covered Project Manager `project.task.manage` | Exact project, lifecycle guard, reason/evidence where mutation is corrective. |
| Start override | Operator `operations.task.start_override` | Recovery-only path, exact task/project, reason, matched grant/permission, audit. |
| Submission gate repair | Operator `operations.submission_gate.repair` | No submission/review rewrite; reason, matched authority, immutable checker evidence. |
| Checker retry | Operator `operations.checker.retry` | New attempt/supersession evidence; no prior result deletion. |
| Review lease force release | Operator `review.lease.force_release` under WS-REV-001 | Review-owned lease guards and evidence; no review decision. |

Conceptual historical “admin override” statements are not operations. No
recovery permission may erase checker evidence, create a review decision,
alter an immutable submission, create/alter a contribution record, or bypass
compensation policy.

## Monitoring And Alerts

Required bounded-cardinality metrics cover:

- `workstream_auth_verification_total{result}`;
- `workstream_auth_jwks_cache_total{result}`;
- `workstream_auth_jwks_refresh_total{result}`;
- `workstream_auth_introspection_total{mode,result}`;
- actor first access/conflict and actor/link state;
- authorization allow/deny code and registered permission;
- administrative/project grant state;
- invalidation backlog and reconciliation retry;
- bootstrap attempt/result.

Alerts require an owner, diagnosis steps, safe recovery, escalation path, and
evidence-retention period. Alert on sustained verification failure, unusable
JWKS cache, repeated bootstrap/final-administrator denial, unusual grant
mutation rate, invalidation backlog, and abnormal first-access conflicts.

Platform security/on-call alerts when verification or refresh failures exceed
5% for five minutes, when all JWKS refreshes fail for two consecutive cache
windows, or when required introspection is unavailable for two minutes.
Diagnosis checks the approved issuer configuration, HTTPS reachability, key
rotation window, cache age, and introspection health without printing response
bodies or credentials. Recovery restores the approved issuer endpoint/policy;
it never enables HMAC, development auth, redirects, or an unpinned algorithm.
Escalate to the release owner and security lead and retain redacted incident
metrics/configuration evidence for the normal security incident period.

Never use token, subject, email, `jti`, raw URL, key material, or unbounded
resource IDs as metric labels.

## Authority Mutation Idempotency

Service-actor creation, administrative/project grant issue or revocation,
actor suspension/reactivation/deactivation, and identity-link
revocation/reactivation require a canonical UUID idempotency key. The namespace
is actor-kind, opaque actor reference, closed operation, and key. Reusing that
namespace with a different canonical request produces `idempotency_mismatch`
without exposing the stored digest, record, or response.

Reservation must be the first database write. Business state, one concrete
success event, one linked invalidation event, and the typed replay reference
commit in the same caller-owned transaction. The authorization repository and
service never commit, roll back, open a second session, expire a pending row, or
steal a claim. On mismatch the caller rolls back the reservation transaction,
starts a clean transaction on the same injected session, commits exactly one
privacy-bounded denial event, and then translates the conflict.

A replay reference is internal only. Active administrative routes load the
canonical resource and evaluate current authority again before responding;
later route owners must preserve the same rule. There is currently no
invalidation consumer or backlog processor; the durable event is foundation
evidence for the owning later chunk.

## Authority Audit Custody

Authority decisions and invalidation requests use the shared `audit_events`
ledger. Database triggers reject normal `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` for
both lifecycle and authority rows. There is no runtime flag, session setting,
or application-user bypass. Authority timestamps come from the database, and
the application writer joins the caller's transaction so evidence cannot
commit separately from the authority mutation it explains.

Production must run Workstream with a dedicated non-owner database role that
has no DDL, trigger-management, table-owner, superuser, or bypass privileges.
Release verification must fail if the application credential owns
`audit_events` or can disable its triggers. Schema migration credentials are
separate and unavailable to the running service.

Owner-level maintenance is exceptional and requires an approved change record,
an outage or writer drain, and an explicit list of rows and purpose. The
database owner must:

1. begin one transaction and take `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on `audit_events`;
2. record the pre-change row count and trigger state without exporting private data;
3. disable only the named mutation trigger needed for the approved operation;
4. perform only the listed maintenance statements and verify affected IDs/counts;
5. re-enable the trigger before commit and prove all three audit triggers enabled;
6. retain redacted change evidence and return credentials to controlled storage.

Do not use owner maintenance to revise authority history, erase a denial, or
fabricate evidence. Normal migration downgrade refuses while authority rows
exist; destructive cleanup requires a separately reviewed retention or legal
procedure and is not an application operation.

## Incident Response

For suspected authority misuse:

1. Preserve request/correlation IDs and append-only authority evidence.
2. Suspend/revoke through supported operations when current authority permits.
3. Confirm same-token denial on the next request.
4. Inspect exact matched grant, permission, project, and resource guards.
5. Reconcile affected assignments without rewriting submitted/review history.
6. Escalate final-administrator risk before any state mutation.
7. Record corrective action and retained evidence without secrets or private
   artifact content.

## Live Proof Responsibility

The final release owner coordinates a supported API/command drill proving:

- first human access;
- one-time bootstrap and concurrent conflict;
- scoped administrative grants;
- exact-project submitter/reviewer grants;
- admin/contributor separation and self-action denial;
- same-unexpired-token revocation;
- suspension/reactivation and link revocation;
- service subject handling;
- cross-project concealment;
- final-administrator concurrency safety;
- authorized audit export and absence of direct database authority edits.

Committed proof uses approved redacted placeholders and never production
tokens, private keys, raw claims, private actor/source IDs, or local paths.

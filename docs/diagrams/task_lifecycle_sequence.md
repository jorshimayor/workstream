# Task Lifecycle Sequence

This sequence shows the v0.1 operating loop from project guide to reviewer and
submitter contributions, conditional compensation awards, and fulfillment.

It is intentionally separate from the future identity and settlement diagram.
v0.1 records immutable awards and fulfillment receipts/projections; reputation
events and portable reputation are deferred.

## Lifecycle Invariants

- New TaskAssignments and ReviewLeases require an active published
  `ContributionPolicyVersion` to freeze.
- A contributor submission creates a new immutable submission version; locked artifacts are not edited in place.
- Review decisions are exactly `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`.
- `needs_revision` commits the immutable Review and task effect first. Before
  contributor access, Workstream appends frozen preparation and later requires
  immutable responses and resolutions for prior blocking findings.
- Every valid human Review creates a reviewer contribution. Accept additionally
  creates FinalAcceptance, which alone sources the submitter contribution.
- Compensation fulfillment status is separate from task acceptance.

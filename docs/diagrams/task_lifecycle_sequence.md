# Task Lifecycle Sequence

This sequence shows the v0.1 operating loop from project guide to accepted contribution and payment/reputation records.

It is intentionally separate from the future identity and settlement diagram. v0.1 records payment status and reputation events internally; it does not execute on-chain settlement or write portable agent reputation.

  PM->>UI: Activate guide
  UI->>API: POST activate guide
  API->>DB: Validate required policy context and mark guide active
  API->>DB: Audit project activation

  PM->>UI: Create and screen task
  UI->>API: POST task, then screen/release
  API->>DB: Lock active guide and policy versions onto task
  API->>DB: Move DRAFT -> SCREENING -> READY
  API->>DB: Audit transitions

  Worker->>UI: Claim task
  UI->>API: POST claim
  API->>Auth: Verify Flow token
  Auth-->>API: ActorContext(worker)
  API->>DB: Validate visibility, profile, skill tags, and READY status
  API->>DB: Create assignment and move READY -> CLAIMED -> IN_PROGRESS

  Worker->>UI: Submit packet
  UI->>API: POST submission packet with evidence and artifact manifest
  API->>Storage: Store or reference artifacts through storage abstraction
  API->>DB: Create immutable submission version
  API->>DB: Lock submission version and audit submitter-owned finalization

  API->>Checks: Enqueue automated checks through Celery
  Checks->>Storage: Read referenced artifacts
  Checks->>DB: Persist checker run and results
  Checks->>DB: Keep task EVALUATION_PENDING while pre-review gate runs
  Checks->>DB: Move to REVIEW_PENDING, NEEDS_REVISION, or internal task_setup_blocked

  Reviewer->>UI: Review packet
  UI->>API: Submit review decision
  API->>Auth: Verify Flow token
  Auth-->>API: ActorContext(reviewer)
  API->>DB: Store decision: accept, needs_revision, or reject

  alt needs_revision
    API->>DB: Create revision requirements from findings
    Worker->>UI: Submit revision replay
    UI->>API: POST revision replay and new submission version
    API->>DB: Link replay to prior findings
    API->>Checks: Run checks again
  else accept
    API->>DB: Create contribution record
    API->>DB: Create payment record with PENDING status
    API->>DB: Create reputation event
    API->>DB: Audit acceptance
  else reject
    API->>DB: Store rejection decision and findings
    API->>DB: Apply payment and reputation policy effects
    API->>DB: Audit rejection
  end
```

## Lifecycle Invariants

- A task cannot enter `READY` without locked guide, checker, review, revision, and payment policy context.
- A worker submission creates a new immutable submission version; locked artifacts are not edited in place.
- Review decisions are exactly `accept`, `needs_revision`, or `reject`.
- `needs_revision` starts a revision loop and must replay prior findings.
- Accepted work creates a contribution record before payment or reputation records.
- Payment status is separate from task acceptance.

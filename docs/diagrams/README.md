# Workstream Architecture Diagrams

This diagram pack explains Workstream at two levels:

- the 30-day v0.1 implementation that is being built now
- the broader Workstream ecosystem that can connect later to external origins, agent identity, task contracts, settlement rails, and portable reputation

The architecture diagrams use C4-PlantUML source files so they render with real C4 system, container, component, boundary, and external-system boxes. The task lifecycle sequence remains Mermaid because GitHub renders it directly and the sequence is easier to read in that format.

## Diagram Index

- [System Context](workstream_context.md)
- [v0.1 Container View](workstream_v01_container.md)
- [v0.1 Backend Component View](backend_v01_components.md)
- [Task Lifecycle Sequence](task_lifecycle_sequence.md)
- [Future Identity, Task Contract, Settlement, And Reputation View](future_identity_payment_reputation.md)

## PlantUML Sources

- [workstream_context.puml](workstream_context.puml)
- [workstream_v01_container.puml](workstream_v01_container.puml)
- [backend_v01_components.puml](backend_v01_components.puml)
- [future_identity_payment_reputation.puml](future_identity_payment_reputation.puml)

## Legend

- blue: current v0.1 Workstream implementation
- green: durable Workstream records
- gray: external people or systems
- yellow: later adapter boundary

## Render Locally

Install PlantUML or point `PLANTUML_JAR` at a local PlantUML jar, then run:

```bash
docs/diagrams/render_plantuml.sh
```

The rendered SVGs are written to `docs/diagrams/rendered/` and are committed so the architecture pages display directly in GitHub.

## Reading Order

Start with the [System Context](workstream_context.md) to explain what Workstream is and what it does not own. Then use the [v0.1 Container View](workstream_v01_container.md) to show what is actually being implemented in the first 30 days. Use the backend component and lifecycle diagrams when the discussion moves from product architecture into implementation design.

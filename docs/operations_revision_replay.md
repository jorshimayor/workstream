# Revision Replay

## Status And Purpose

This is the planned v0.1 operating contract. Revision behavior remains
unavailable until its owning REV chunks, exact AUTH activation, and REV-13C joint
release complete.

Revision replay preserves an immutable answer to three questions: what the
reviewer required, how the submitter responded, and how a later reviewer
resolved each issue. No participant edits a prior Review, finding, response, or
resolution.

## Review-Rooted Preparation

Controlled revision replay begins only from one immutable
`Review(needs_revision)`. Checker remediation remains a separate CheckerRun-
rooted resubmission path using the Task's existing locked context; it does not
fabricate a Review, finding, preparation, reviewer contribution, or human actor.

Before contributor access, Workstream appends a RevisionContextPreparation. It
compares the prior Submission's stamped Project Guide identity and activation
sequence with the currently active guide:

- exact pair match: `kept`;
- any different valid active pair: `rebased` with `forward` or `backward`;
- missing, incomplete, inconsistent, revoked, or unsafe context: `blocked`.

The preparation freezes the selected guide/source/task-execution policy context,
context digest, prior Submission, originating Review, source and target
TaskAssignments, and change summary. Task Context returns the validated head,
not a moving live guide. No guide rebase occurs during review; the reviewer
reads the context stamped on the leased Submission.

ContributionPolicyVersion is independent. The TaskAssignment freeze and each
ReviewLease freeze never change because guide context rebases.

## Submitter Response

For each unresolved blocking ReviewFinding, the assigned submitter creates one
immutable SubmissionFindingResponse containing:

- finding ID;
- response text and concrete change summary;
- optional finalized evidence binding;
- exact preparation head ID and digest;
- target Submission and TaskAssignment lineage.

Advisory findings may be answered but do not block resubmission unless the locked
policy explicitly requires a response. Vague aggregate “fixed all” text cannot
replace per-finding responses. The distinct checker-remediation path uses only
contributor-safe checker messages/fixes and requires no fabricated
ReviewFinding response or resolution.

## Resubmission And Checks

Submission N+1 acknowledges the exact preparation head/digest, links its
immediate predecessor, and stamps the frozen context. The normal finalization
and checker spine reruns. Only a current successful `allow_review` may create a
new queue entry.

Human Review return initially prefers the reviewer who requested revision. The
distinct corrected checker path enters open routing. Expiry,
decline, or invalidation opens the entry without resetting queue age.

## Reviewer Resolution

The later Review appends one FindingResolution for every required prior finding:

- `resolved`;
- `unresolved`;
- `not_applicable`.

Each resolution carries bounded rationale and optional evidence. It never edits
the original finding or submitter response. A new guide-grounded issue becomes a
new ReviewFinding on the later Review.

## Limits And Recovery

Exact human Review round counting, deadline anchor, and boundary require human
approval before implementation and exclude checker retries. Approved values use
database time and freeze on the Review-rooted episode. A reached revision limit
or deadline blocks further preparation and
`submission.create`; it does not automatically reject or cancel the task. The
task remains `needs_revision` until a covered Project Manager explicitly invokes
the planned reason-bound obligation-close command. That administrative closure
uses task `cancelled`, releases the assignment, and creates no synthetic Review
or contribution.

A blocked or invalid context preparation can be repaired only by appending one
successor through the planned covered-manager repair command. Repair cannot
bypass limit/deadline exhaustion. Exact durable CheckerRun remediation is not
legacy; only ambiguous or truly rootless claimed human Review state uses
Operator evidence-linked close.

## Required Proof

A revision cannot return to human review unless every unresolved blocking
finding has one response, the exact preparation is still current, Submission
lineage is immediate and same-task, evidence bindings are finalized, and the
new CheckerRun is current for that Submission.

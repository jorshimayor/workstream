# Revision Replay

## Status And Purpose

This is the planned v0.1 operating contract. Revision behavior remains
unavailable until its owning REV chunks, exact AUTH activation, and REV-13 joint
release complete.

Revision replay preserves an immutable answer to three questions: what the
reviewer required, how the submitter responded, and how a later reviewer
resolved each issue. No participant edits a prior Review, finding, response, or
resolution.

## Review-Rooted Preparation

Human revision begins only from an immutable `Review(needs_revision)`. Checker
remediation remains CheckerResult-rooted and does not fabricate a Review episode.

Before contributor access, Workstream appends a RevisionContextPreparation. It
compares the prior Submission's stamped Project Guide identity and activation
sequence with the currently active guide:

- exact pair match: `kept`;
- any different valid active pair: `rebased` with `forward` or `backward`;
- missing, incomplete, inconsistent, revoked, or unsafe context: `blocked`.

The preparation freezes the selected guide/source/task-execution policy context,
context digest, prior Submission, originating Review, source and target
TaskAssignments, and change summary. Task Context returns the validated head,
not a moving live guide. The reviewer never rebases and reads the context stamped
on the leased Submission.

ContributionPolicyVersion is independent. The TaskAssignment freeze and each
ReviewLease freeze never change because guide context rebases.

## Submitter Response

For each unresolved blocking ReviewFinding, the assigned submitter creates one
immutable SubmissionFindingResponse containing:

- finding ID;
- response text and concrete change summary;
- optional finalized evidence binding;
- exact preparation head ID and digest;
- target Submission and TaskAssignment lineage.

Advisory findings may be answered but do not block resubmission unless the locked
policy explicitly requires a response. Vague aggregate “fixed all” text cannot
replace per-finding responses.

## Resubmission And Checks

Submission N+1 acknowledges the exact preparation head/digest, links its
immediate predecessor, and stamps the frozen context. The normal finalization
and checker spine reruns. Only a current successful `allow_review` may create a
new queue entry.

The queue initially prefers the reviewer who requested revision. Expiry,
decline, or invalidation opens the entry without resetting queue age.

## Reviewer Resolution

The later Review appends one FindingResolution for every required prior finding:

- `resolved`;
- `unresolved`;
- `not_applicable`.

Each resolution carries bounded rationale and optional evidence. It never edits
the original finding or submitter response. A new guide-grounded issue becomes a
new ReviewFinding on the later Review.

## Limits And Recovery

A reached revision limit or deadline blocks further preparation and
`submission.create`; it does not automatically reject or cancel the task. The
task remains `needs_revision` until a covered Project Manager explicitly invokes
the planned reason-bound obligation-close command. That administrative closure
uses task `cancelled`, releases the assignment, and creates no synthetic Review
or contribution.

A blocked or invalid Review-rooted preparation can be repaired only by appending
one successor through the planned covered-manager repair command. Legacy
`needs_revision` state with no Review/root requires an Operator evidence-linked
legacy close and cannot enter normal revision replay.

## Required Proof

A revision cannot return to human review unless every unresolved blocking
finding has one response, the exact preparation is still current, Submission
lineage is immediate and same-task, evidence bindings are finalized, and the
new CheckerRun is current for that Submission.

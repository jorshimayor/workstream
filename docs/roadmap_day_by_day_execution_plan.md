# Day-by-Day Execution Plan

## Purpose

This is the execution calendar for the first 30 days. The master plan explains the strategy; this file defines what happens each day and what must be true before moving on.

The plan assumes a small team:

- 1 product/ops lead
- 1 backend engineer
- 1 frontend engineer
- 1 reviewer/quality lead
- 1 finance/reconciliation owner

If the team is smaller, keep the sequence and reduce scope, not the quality gates.

## Week 1: Backend Foundation

Week 1 is backend-first. The frontend starts after the backend contract, lifecycle guards, and first workflow are stable.

The backend is a modular monolith. Routers stay thin, services own workflow rules, repositories own database queries, interfaces define external boundaries, and adapters implement those boundaries.

Each implementation chunk must have a specification and conditions of satisfaction before code starts. Senior engineering, QA/test, and security/auth verification are required before operator final review.

### Day 1: Freeze Product Contract

Deliver:

- product brief accepted
- lifecycle state machine accepted
- entity list accepted
- first three project templates named
- initial operating principles frozen
- Week 1 backend chunk plan accepted
- modular monolith boundaries accepted
- external Flow auth verification boundary accepted

Exit criteria:

- no task can exist without a project
- no project can exist without a guide
- no accepted task can exist without payment and evidence concepts
- no backend implementation starts without chunk specification and conditions of satisfaction

### Day 2: Project And Guide Records

Deliver:

- `WorkstreamProject`
- `ProjectGuide`
- guide versioning
- guide approval and active-version locking
- submission artifact policy fields
- generated project pre-submit checker policy fields
- post-submit checker policy fields
- review policy fields
- revision policy fields
- payment policy fields
- base amount fields
- payment dispute policy fields
- active/inactive project status
- SQLAlchemy 2.x async model shape
- Pydantic request/response schemas

Exit criteria:

- create a project from a markdown guide
- retrieve the active guide version for a task
- edit a draft guide without changing historical task guide versions
- block project activation when guide source snapshot, submission artifact policy, effective project submission artifact policy hash, post-submit checker, review policy, revision policy, payment policy, or project pre-submit checker bundle hash is missing
- block task readiness when locked guide snapshot, effective project submission artifact policy hash, or project pre-submit checker bundle hash is missing
- migrations and model tests define the expected invariants

### Day 3: Task Queue

Deliver:

- `WorkstreamTask`
- queue lanes
- task create/edit
- screening/readiness gate
- task status transition table
- audit event for each status change
- task-owned locked guide and policy context

Exit criteria:

- create task in `DRAFT`
- move task to `SCREENING` only when required fields exist
- move task to `READY` only after screening passes
- view queues by status
- every transition writes an actor-attributed audit event

### Day 4: People And Assignment

Deliver:

- `ActorIdentity`
- `ActorProfile`
- Workstream-owned role assignment direction
- assignment/claim flow
- skill tags
- external Flow actor identity mapped into Workstream actor context

Exit criteria:

- assign task to worker
- move `READY -> CLAIMED -> IN_PROGRESS`
- prevent two workers owning the same task unless project policy allows it
- Workstream verifies Flow-issued tokens and does not own passwords or login

### Day 5: Submission Packet

Deliver:

- `Submission`
- `SubmissionArtifact`
- evidence upload/reference
- package hash field
- artifact hash manifest
- worker attestation
- submission versioning
- server-stamped locked guide and policy context from the task

Exit criteria:

- submit v1 packet
- worker does not provide submission version, guide version, submission artifact policy version, pre-submit checker bundle hash, post-submit checker policy version, review policy version, revision policy version, or payment policy version
- blocking pre-submit failures create no submission row, no submission version, no `SUBMITTED` transition, and no submission-created audit event
- task moves to `SUBMITTED`
- package/evidence records are immutable after checker run starts
- replacing any artifact creates v2 instead of mutating v1

## Week 2: Checker System

Week 2 is backend-first checker infrastructure. Checker output is exposed through APIs, backend contract drills, and operational debug output. It does not build the product frontend, reviewer queue UI, review decision form, contribution records, payment records, or reputation updates.

The core invariant is:

`Draft packet -> Pre-submit checks -> Submit -> Finalize -> Internal CheckerRun -> CheckerResults -> review_pending | needs_revision | internal task_setup_blocked -> trusted checker retry when repaired`

The checker framework does not accept or reject work. It may route worker-fixable checker failures to user-facing `needs_revision`, but that does not create a human review decision. Internally the source is recorded as `auto_checker`.

### Day 6: Checker Interface

Deliver:

- checker result contract
- checker runner
- checker severity model
- `CheckerRun`
- `CheckerResult`

Exit criteria:

- run a checker against a submission
- store `passed`, `warning`, and `failed` results
- expose checker run and result data through backend API responses and API drill/debug output
- no product frontend task page is added in Week 2
- checker records can distinguish pre-submit feedback from post-submit internal auto checks

### Day 7: Core Structural Checkers

Deliver:

- `check_policy_context_present`
- `check_submission_packet`
- `check_required_files`
- `check_forbidden_files`

Exit criteria:

- worker-fixable submission failures fail before review
- locked post-submit checker policy blocking failures block `review_pending`
- checker runs bind to the exact submission id, submission version, package hash, and artifact hash manifest
- worker-fixable checker failures route to user-facing `needs_revision`

### Day 8: Evidence And Acceptance Checkers

Deliver:

- `check_evidence_present`
- `check_evidence_integrity`
- `check_acceptance_criteria_present`
- `check_policy_context_present`
- `check_forbidden_files`
- `check_confidentiality_attestation`
- first version of `check_low_quality_generated_artifacts`

Exit criteria:

- task cannot become review-pending with no evidence
- task cannot become review-pending when checker artifact hashes do not match submission hashes

Exit criteria:

- two projects can require different submission artifacts and post-submit checkers
- generated pre-submit policy comes from Workstream defaults plus project submission artifact policy

# Chunk 5: Submission Packet Foundation

## Purpose

This chunk adds the backend record for worker submission packets. A worker submits against a task id, Workstream runs pre-submit intake checks from the locked project pre-submit checker policy, stamps the task's locked guide source snapshot, effective project submission artifact policy, project pre-submit checker bundle, post-submit checker, review, revision, and payment context, and every submitted packet version becomes immutable once locked for checker execution.

This completes the Week 1 backend lifecycle through `SUBMITTED`.

## Scope

- submission packet model
- evidence item model
- generated pre-submit intake gate before submission creation
- package URI and package hash metadata
- artifact hash manifest
- worker attestation
- submission versioning
- task transition from `IN_PROGRESS` to `SUBMITTED`
- submission audit events
- API paths for creating, reading, listing, and locking submission packets

## Non-Scope

- new post-submit checker execution behavior beyond the existing lock-triggered gate
- new checker run record schema
- human review decisions
- revision replay enforcement
- contribution, payment, or reputation records
- direct file upload or object storage implementation

Chunk 5 stores package and evidence references. Actual file storage still belongs behind the later object-storage abstraction.

## Data Model

`submissions`

- `id`
- `task_id`
- `worker_id`
- `version`
- `status`
- `summary`
- `package_uri`
- `package_hash`
- `artifact_hash_manifest`
- `worker_attestation`
- `locked_guide_version`
- `locked_guide_source_snapshot_id`
- `locked_guide_source_snapshot_hash`
- `locked_effective_project_submission_artifact_policy_id`
- `locked_effective_project_submission_artifact_policy_hash`
- `locked_pre_submit_checker_policy_id`
- `locked_pre_submit_checker_bundle_hash`
- `locked_checker_policy_version`
- `locked_review_policy_version`
- `locked_revision_policy_version`
- `locked_payment_policy_version`
- `submitted_at`
- `locked_at`
- `supersedes_submission_id`

Submissions intentionally reference the task's locked guide and policy fields, including guide-source snapshot provenance, effective project submission artifact policy provenance, and project pre-submit checker compiled bundle hash provenance. This prevents task-owned locked context from changing silently after a submission has been recorded.

Implementation note: current v0.1 code uses `locked_checker_policy_version` for post-submit checker policy provenance. The architecture target splits post-submit checker provenance into an explicit `PostSubmitCheckerPolicy` in a later chunk.

`evidence_items`

- `id`
- `submission_id`
- `type`
- `label`
- `uri`
- `hash`
- `size_bytes`
- `locked_at`
- `metadata`
- `created_at`

## API Contract

POST `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/submission-precheck`

Runs non-authoritative pre-submit feedback against the task's locked project
`PreSubmitCheckerPolicy`. This endpoint does not create a submission row,
submission version, durable checker run, task transition, or submission-created
audit event.

Request body:

- `submission`
  - `summary`
  - `package_uri`
  - `package_hash`
  - `artifact_hash_manifest`
  - `worker_attestation`
  - `evidence_items`

Response body:

- `task_id`
- `authoritative` set to `false`
- `status` as `passed` or `failed`
- `eligible_to_submit`
- `results`

POST `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/submissions`

Runs pre-submit checks from the locked project pre-submit checker policy for the assigned worker's draft packet. Creates a new submission version only when blocking pre-submit checks pass.

Request body:

- `summary`
- `package_uri`
- `package_hash`
- `artifact_hash_manifest`
- `worker_attestation`
- `evidence_items`

The request body must not accept guide source snapshot ids or hashes, effective project submission artifact policy ids or hashes, project pre-submit checker policy ids or bundle hashes, or guide/checker/review/revision/payment policy version fields. Those fields come from the task.

The request body must not accept checker names, checker severities, checker outcomes, submission version, evidence ids, or checker run ids. Workstream owns those values.

GET `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/submissions`

Lists submission versions for a task visible to the current actor.

GET `/api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}`

Returns one visible submission packet.

POST `/api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}/lock`

Locks a submission packet and triggers the current post-submit checker gate. Locking makes the packet immutable in place. This uses the existing checker gate behavior; defining the dedicated post-submit checker policy model remains separate scope.

## Versioning Rules

- the first packet for a task is version `1`
- each later packet for that task creates version `2`, `3`, and so on
- Workstream assigns submission versions server-side
- client-provided submission versions are rejected
- a later packet sets `supersedes_submission_id` to the previous latest submission id
- `supersedes_submission_id` must point to the previous latest submission for the same task
- existing submission rows are never edited to replace artifacts
- artifact changes require a new submission version
- evidence rows belong to exactly one submission version
- locked submission packets cannot be mutated in place
- concurrent version conflicts return a controlled conflict response instead of a server error

## Lifecycle Rules

- a worker can submit only when assigned to the task
- first submission requires task status `IN_PROGRESS`
- Workstream loads the locked effective project submission artifact policy hash before creating a submission
- Workstream loads the locked generated project pre-submit checker compiled bundle hash before creating a submission
- blocking pre-submit failures prevent submission creation
- when blocking pre-submit fails, no submission row is created, no submission version is assigned, no task transition to `SUBMITTED` occurs, and no submission-created audit event is written
- first submission moves the task to `SUBMITTED`
- later replacement submissions are allowed only after the task reaches `NEEDS_REVISION`
- submission packet content must satisfy the locked project pre-submit checker policy
- every submission creation writes a task audit event
- the audit event includes submission id, submission version, worker id, package hash, and artifact hash manifest
- locking a submission writes a task audit event
- only the latest submission version for a task can be locked
- Chunk 5 submission status is `submitted`; locking sets `locked_at` and does not change status

## Security And Auth

- Workstream still verifies external Flow auth only
- no Workstream-owned login or primary auth session is added
- only the assigned worker can create a submission for the task
- project managers and admins can read and lock submissions for operational flow
- workers can read their own task submissions
- response payloads return server-stamped locked guide source snapshot ids/hashes, effective project submission artifact policy ids/hashes, project pre-submit checker policy ids/bundle hashes, and guide/checker/review/revision/payment policy versions
- package and evidence URIs are stored as object references, not signed URLs or credentials
- persisted storage references are Workstream-issued opaque object references or validated object-storage adapter references
- raw signed URLs, credential-bearing URLs, query strings, local filesystem paths, bucket secrets, and token-bearing references are rejected before persistence
- normalization is allowed only for already-approved adapter references that contain no secrets, credentials, or query material

## Evidence Identity

Workstream generates evidence item ids at persistence time. Worker-provided manifest rows may include artifact paths or URIs, but the persisted evidence item id is the stable Workstream evidence id for later checker and review records.

## Audit Scope

Chunk 5 writes task audit events with submission identifiers in `event_payload`. Direct submission audit streams are deferred until a dedicated submission-review surface needs them.

## Conditions Of Satisfaction

- worker submits a draft packet against `task_id` and Workstream assigns version `1` after blocking pre-submit checks pass
- worker does not provide locked guide source snapshot, effective project submission artifact policy, project pre-submit checker, or guide/checker/review/revision/payment policy context
- worker-provided locked guide source snapshot, effective project submission artifact policy, project pre-submit checker, or guide/checker/review/revision/payment policy context fields are rejected by the API schema
- worker-provided submission version fields are rejected by the API schema
- worker-provided checker names, checker outcomes, evidence ids, and checker run ids are rejected by the API schema
- preflight failures return `PreSubmitCheckResponse(status="failed", eligible_to_submit=false, results=[...])`
- blocked submission-create attempts return `DomainError(code="pre_submission_checker_failed")` with structured pass/fail/warning details and create no submission row, no submission version, no task transition to `SUBMITTED`, and no submission-created audit event
- Workstream stamps locked guide source snapshot ids/hashes, effective project submission artifact policy ids/hashes, project pre-submit checker policy ids/bundle hashes, and guide/checker/review/revision/payment policy versions from task context
- task moves to `SUBMITTED`
- submitted packet can be locked and automatically enters the current post-submit checker gate
- replacing an artifact creates a new submission version instead of mutating v1
- submission audit events include task, worker, version, package, and artifact context
- submission and immutability tests pass

## Proposed Next

AUTH-05A merged through PR #115 as `8e1cde6`, and CAT plus its post-merge memory
merged through PRs #117 and #118. AUTH-05B merged through PR #119 as `ad71c7e`.
AUTH-06 merged through PR #124 as `f599551`. AUTH-07A, AUTH-07B, and AUTH-08
merged through PRs #126, #130, and #131. WS-XINT planning merged through PR
#139. `WS-AUTH-001-XINT` now reconciles AUTH's owner plan. AUTH-09A remains open
and conflicting in PR #132; converge and re-review it only after this planning
amendment merges. Do not start an AUTH-09 successor or POL-002-04 automatically.

Coverage R10 merged through PR #108. Do not start 01B2, chunk 02, or another
coverage implementation chunk from this worktree.

`WS-ART-001-01`, the AWS-first planning amendment, and `02A1` are merged. R2
and Flow Node are deferred. `02A2` merged through PR #129 as `9a04434`.
`02A3` is reviewed in its isolated worktree and awaits its own PR publication
and human review; later ART chunks remain inactive.

Coverage work proceeds independently in its own worktree and is not owned by
this AUTH queue update.

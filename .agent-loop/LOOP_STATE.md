# Loop State

## Current State

- Active initiative: `WS-POL-001` - Submission Artifact Policy Foundation
- Active planning chunk: none
- Active implementation chunk: `WS-POL-001-07`
- Branch: `codex/ws-pol-001-07-task-contract-cleanup`
- Status: `WS-POL-001-06` is merged to `main` through PR #67 as `3cce92c`.
  `WS-POL-001-07` is active and removes the remaining task-owned
  `required_files` / `required_evidence` artifact requirement fields from the
  task API, ORM model, migration state, tests, scripts, and docs.
- Last merged implementation SHA: `3cce92c`
- Last merge commit: `3cce92c`
- Current gate: `WS-POL-001-07` implementation in progress
- Next chunk: inactive until `WS-POL-001-07` is merged by the user

## Operating Rule

Workstream engineering chunks move through:

```text
Intent -> Discovery -> Plan -> Chunk Map -> Chunk Contract -> Implementation -> Evidence -> Internal Review -> PR -> Human Checkpoint -> Memory Update -> Stop
```

The merged `WS-POL-001-03` chunk moved task readiness and submission creation
onto the locked project guide-source snapshot, effective project submission
artifact policy, and compiled project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` bundle. It did
not implement frontend behavior, payment, reputation, settlement, blockchain
integrations, post-submit policy splitting, or revision resubmission drill
behavior.

The active `WS-POL-001-07` chunk removes stale task-owned artifact requirement
fields after the project-guide/payment cleanup exposed the same request-body
problem at task creation. It must not change project policy derivation, checker
compilation, post-submit runtime, Terminal Benchmark example behavior,
frontend behavior, payment, reputation, blockchain integrations, or agent
runtime design.

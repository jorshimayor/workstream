  implementation and CodeRabbit follow-up fixes are committed, deterministic
  verification passed, required internal reviewer tracks completed with no
  blocking findings, and evidence / trust bundle are prepared for human review.
- Last merged implementation SHA: `cc78f2a`

- Next chunk: inactive until `WS-POL-001-11` is reviewed and merged

## Operating Rule

Workstream engineering chunks move through:

```text
Intent -> Discovery -> Plan -> Chunk Map -> Chunk Contract -> Implementation -> Evidence -> Internal Review -> PR -> Human Checkpoint -> Memory Update -> Stop
```

The merged `WS-POL-001-03` chunk moved task readiness and submission creation
onto the locked project guide-source snapshot, effective project submission
artifact policy, and compiled project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` bundle. It did
not implement frontend behavior, payment, reputation, settlement, blockchain
integrations, post-submit policy splitting, or revision resubmission drill
behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-08` chunk corrected the project setup orchestration path:
normal guide/source capture starts the pre-submit setup pipeline automatically
through Celery. It did not redesign post-submit policy, review, revision,
payment, reputation, blockchain integrations, frontend behavior, or task
submission runtime.

The merged `WS-POL-001-09` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
project setup runtime boundary. It removed the production fixture adapter and
did not change task, checker, post-submit, review, revision, payment,
reputation, blockchain, frontend, or object-storage behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-10` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
pre-submit live API drill. It fixed guide-version conflict mapping,
guide-create source snapshot capture, active-guide checker summary visibility,
worker self-profile onboarding, and failed pre-submit audit evidence. It did
not change post-submit policy, review, revision, payment, reputation,
blockchain, frontend, or agent-runtime behavior.

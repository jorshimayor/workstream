# Loop State

## Current State

- This authored file is reviewed planning/history context, not canonical live
  post-merge state. Canonical state is the signed schema-v2 output on
  `automation/loop-memory`.
- Active initiatives include independently owned `WS-AUTH-001`, `WS-ART-001`,
  `WS-REV-001`, and `WS-CON-001`. The planning-only `WS-XINT-001` boundary
  reconciliation merged through PR #139 as `5d353b6` and starts no runtime.
- Active ART implementation chunk: `WS-ART-001-02A3` on
  `codex/ws-art-001-02a3-artifact-store-v2-local-clean-cut`.
- Parallel AUTH, REV, and CON worktrees remain independently owned. This ART
  branch consumes their merged handoff contracts without editing or activating
  their runtime behavior.
- Start basis: PR #129 merged ART-02A2 into `main` as `9a04434`, and PR #139
  then merged the cross-initiative boundary reconciliation as `5d353b6`.
- PR #119 merged `WS-AUTH-001-05B` as `ad71c7e`.
- PR #120 merged `WS-ART-001-OBJECT-STORAGE-AMENDMENT` as `4408256`.
- PR #122 merged the first automated post-merge memory implementation as
  `fc89fb6`; its schema-v1 cross-initiative next pointer is superseded by the
  schema-v2 initiative-local clean cut.
- Current gate: publish the evidence-bound `WS-ART-001-02A3` head for GitHub
  Actions, CodeRabbit, and explicit human review; no later ART chunk starts
  automatically.
- Scope checkpoint: AWS S3 is the only v0.1 production provider; MinIO is
  local/CI S3 protocol proof; LocalStorage is focused development/test; R2 and
  Flow Node are deferred. Product modules receive narrow artifact capabilities,
  and AWS cannot instantiate in production without release-bound live proof.
- Authorization checkpoint: merged main contains 74 PermissionIds and 57
  ActionIds, with the two actor-self and seven AUTH-08 administrative actions
  active. AUTH-09A's reviewed parallel branch defines seven fixed artifact
  service identities and eleven exact planned static matrix memberships. ART
  feature chunks supply hidden canonical behavior/resource composition. Future
  AUTH activation-custodian chunks alone integrate evaluators and change action
  availability after that hidden behavior merges; `WS-XINT-001` activates
  nothing.
- Parallel artifact checkpoint: ART-02A1 merged through PR #127 as `f64a8e5`
  and ART-02A2 merged through PR #129 as `9a04434`. ART-02A3 completed
  merged-main deterministic repair and all nine exact-SHA reviewer tracks at
  `441d39230a341f2c43dd548776a2437ae6b2395d`; it now awaits external checks and
  its own human-reviewed PR. ART-02B1 remains inactive.
- Authorization checkpoint: AUTH-07B and AUTH-08 merged through PRs #130 and
  #131. The user separately started AUTH-09; its 09A subchunk is reviewed in the
  isolated parallel worktree and remains unmerged at this checkpoint.
- Parallel coverage work: `WS-QUAL-001-01B2` remains paused. Its last official
  whole-app result is `6466/8159` statements (`79.249908%`); no replacement
  evidence exists.
- Parallel initiative: `WS-POL-002-03` merged through PR #90 as `a7aa474`; its
  post-merge memory merged through PR #94 as `b1270d7`. `WS-POL-002-04` remains
  inactive pending the relevant authorization proof and a separate explicit
  start.

## Operating Rule

Workstream engineering chunks move through:

```text
Intent -> Discovery -> Plan -> Chunk Map -> Chunk Contract -> Implementation -> Evidence -> Internal Review -> PR -> Human Checkpoint -> Automated Merge Memory -> Stop
```

The merged `WS-POL-001-03` chunk moved task readiness and submission creation
onto the locked project guide-source snapshot, effective project submission
artifact policy, and compiled project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` bundle. It did
not implement frontend behavior, payment, reputation, settlement, blockchain
integrations, post-submit policy splitting, or revision resubmission drill
behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-08` chunk corrected the project setup orchestration path:
normal guide/source capture starts the pre-submit setup pipeline automatically
through Celery. It did not redesign post-submit policy, review, revision,
payment, reputation, blockchain integrations, frontend behavior, or task
submission runtime.

The merged `WS-POL-001-09` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
project setup runtime boundary. It removed the production fixture adapter and
did not change task, checker, post-submit, review, revision, payment,
reputation, blockchain, frontend, or object-storage behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-10` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
pre-submit live API drill. It fixed guide-version conflict mapping,
guide-create source snapshot capture, active-guide checker summary visibility,
contributor self-profile onboarding, and failed pre-submit audit evidence. It did
not change post-submit policy, review, revision, payment, reputation,
blockchain, frontend, or agent-runtime behavior.

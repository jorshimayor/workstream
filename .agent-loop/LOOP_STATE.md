# Loop State

## Current State

- Active initiative in this worktree: `WS-ART-001` - Immutable Artifact Storage
- Active planning chunk: `WS-ART-001-OBJECT-STORAGE-AMENDMENT`
- Active implementation chunk: none
- Branch: `codex/ws-art-001-object-storage-planning-amendment`
- Worktree: `/home/abiorh/flow/workstream`
- Latest integrated `main` merge commit: `eba7e2b` from PR #118.
- Status: planning repair only. Candidate `e641588` passed deterministic gates
  but failed exact-head senior engineering, architecture, QA/test, and
  security/auth review. All four sessions were closed and their valid findings
  are being repaired before a new immutable review SHA is created.
- Current gate: finish the bounded repair, rerun deterministic proof, review one
  exact SHA through every required internal track, record evidence/trust bundle,
  then stop for external and human review. No storage runtime implementation is
  active.
- Scope checkpoint: AWS S3 is the only v0.1 production provider; MinIO is
  local/CI S3 protocol proof; LocalStorage is focused development/test; R2 and
  Flow Node are deferred. Product modules receive narrow artifact capabilities,
  and AWS cannot instantiate in production without release-bound live proof.
- Authorization checkpoint: the approved catalogue contains 73 identifiers,
  including 21 artifact permissions. AUTH-07 registers them, AUTH-08 defines
  applicable Operator grants, AUTH-09 provisions fixed service principals, and
  each owning WS-ART feature chunk activates only its own canonical actions.
- Next artifact chunk: `WS-ART-001-02A1` remains inactive until this amendment
  merges and the user gives a separate explicit start signal.
- Parallel authorization work: `WS-AUTH-001-05B` has a recorded start signal and
  remains owned by `/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-authorization-service`; do not
  implement it from this artifact worktree.
- Parallel coverage work: `WS-QUAL-001-01B2` remains paused. Its last official
  whole-app result is `6466/8159` statements (`79.249908%`); no replacement
  evidence exists.
- Parallel initiative: `WS-POL-002-03` merged through PR #90 as `a7aa474`; its
  post-merge memory merged through PR #94 as `b1270d7`. `WS-POL-002-04` remains
  inactive pending the relevant authorization proof and a separate explicit
  start.

## Operating Rule

Workstream engineering chunks move through:

```text
Intent -> Discovery -> Plan -> Chunk Map -> Chunk Contract -> Implementation -> Evidence -> Internal Review -> PR -> Human Checkpoint -> Memory Update -> Stop
```

The merged `WS-POL-001-03` chunk moved task readiness and submission creation
onto the locked project guide-source snapshot, effective project submission
artifact policy, and compiled project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` bundle. It did
not implement frontend behavior, payment, reputation, settlement, blockchain
integrations, post-submit policy splitting, or revision resubmission drill
behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-08` chunk corrected the project setup orchestration path:
normal guide/source capture starts the pre-submit setup pipeline automatically
through Celery. It did not redesign post-submit policy, review, revision,
payment, reputation, blockchain integrations, frontend behavior, or task
submission runtime.

The merged `WS-POL-001-09` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
project setup runtime boundary. It removed the production fixture adapter and
did not change task, checker, post-submit, review, revision, payment,
reputation, blockchain, frontend, or object-storage behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-10` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
pre-submit live API drill. It fixed guide-version conflict mapping,
guide-create source snapshot capture, active-guide checker summary visibility,
contributor self-profile onboarding, and failed pre-submit audit evidence. It did
not change post-submit policy, review, revision, payment, reputation,
blockchain, frontend, or agent-runtime behavior.

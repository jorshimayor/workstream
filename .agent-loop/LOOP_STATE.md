# Loop State

## Current State

- Active initiative: `WS-AUTH-001` - Workstream Authorization Service
- Active planning chunk: none
- Active implementation chunk: `WS-AUTH-001-04` - Request, Error, And API
  Control Foundation
- Branch: `codex/ws-auth-001-04-request-api-controls`
- Worktree: `/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-auth-001-04`
- Status: AUTH-03 post-merge memory merged through PR #110 as `1864867`; the
  user explicitly started AUTH-04 and its L1 preimplementation review is active.
- Prior `WS-AUTH-001-01` reviewed implementation SHA: `be0b836`
- Prior `WS-AUTH-001-01` final merged branch head: `b5217e1`
- Latest integrated `main` merge commit: `1864867`
- Current gate: AUTH-04 discovery and required preimplementation plan review.
- Next chunk: none; do not start `WS-AUTH-001-05` automatically.
- Parallel initiative: `WS-QUAL-001-01B1B-R10` merged through PR #108 as
  `5c47aba`, and this convergence records its post-merge memory. B2 remains
  inactive pending a separate explicit user start; coverage chunk 02 remains
  inactive pending B2 merge/memory and its separate explicit start.
- Parallel initiative: `WS-ART-001-01` merged through PR #101 as `050eb15`.
  `WS-ART-001-02` remains proposed and inactive pending a separate explicit
  user start.
- Parallel initiative: `WS-POL-002-03` merged through PR #90 as `a7aa474`; its
  post-merge memory merged through PR #94 as `b1270d7`. `WS-POL-002-04` remains
  inactive pending the relevant authorization proof and a separate explicit
  start.

## Operating Rule

Workstream engineering chunks move through:

```text
Intent -> Discovery -> Plan -> Chunk Map -> Chunk Contract -> Implementation -> Evidence -> Internal Review -> PR -> Human Checkpoint -> Memory Update -> Stop
```

The merged `WS-POL-001-03` chunk moved task readiness and submission creation
onto the locked project guide-source snapshot, effective project submission
artifact policy, and compiled project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` bundle. It did
not implement frontend behavior, payment, reputation, settlement, blockchain
integrations, post-submit policy splitting, or revision resubmission drill
behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-08` chunk corrected the project setup orchestration path:
normal guide/source capture starts the pre-submit setup pipeline automatically
through Celery. It did not redesign post-submit policy, review, revision,
payment, reputation, blockchain integrations, frontend behavior, or task
submission runtime.

The merged `WS-POL-001-09` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
project setup runtime boundary. It removed the production fixture adapter and
did not change task, checker, post-submit, review, revision, payment,
reputation, blockchain, frontend, or object-storage behavior.

The merged `WS-POL-001-10` chunk was a corrective hardening chunk for the
pre-submit live API drill. It fixed guide-version conflict mapping,
guide-create source snapshot capture, active-guide checker summary visibility,
contributor self-profile onboarding, and failed pre-submit audit evidence. It did
not change post-submit policy, review, revision, payment, reputation,
blockchain, frontend, or agent-runtime behavior.

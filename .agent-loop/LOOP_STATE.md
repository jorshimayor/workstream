# Loop State

## Current State

- Active initiative: `WS-POL-001` - Submission Artifact Policy Foundation
- Active planning chunk: none
- Active implementation chunk: `WS-POL-001-06`
- Branch: `codex/ws-pol-001-06-terminal-benchmark-drill`
- Status: `WS-POL-001-05` is merged to `main`; `WS-POL-001-06` live manual API
  proof exposed and fixed an OpenAI Agents SDK adapter issue; final
  verification and internal review re-check are in progress
- Last merged implementation SHA: `b20988ba79626e1edbc03953aba60f54f2fc94ab`
- Last merge commit: `b20988ba79626e1edbc03953aba60f54f2fc94ab`
- Current gate: `WS-POL-001-06` final verification and internal review re-check
- Next chunk: inactive until `WS-POL-001-06` is internally reviewed, externally
  reviewed, and merged by the user

## Operating Rule

Workstream engineering chunks move through:

```text
Intent -> Discovery -> Plan -> Chunk Map -> Chunk Contract -> Implementation -> Evidence -> Internal Review -> PR -> Human Checkpoint -> Memory Update -> Stop
```

The merged `WS-POL-001-03` chunk moved task readiness and submission creation
onto the locked project guide-source snapshot, effective project submission
artifact policy, and compiled project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` bundle. It did
not implement frontend behavior, payment, reputation, settlement, blockchain
integrations, post-submit policy splitting, or revision resubmission drill
behavior.

The active `WS-POL-001-06` chunk uses real Terminal Benchmark reviewer fixture
material to prove the current Workstream setup-agent route, project policy
bundle, task locked context, pre-submit, submission versioning, post-submit
checker, and fixed revision path through live manual API calls. It also fixes a
narrow OpenAI Agents SDK adapter issue found by that live drill. It must not add
Terminal Benchmark-specific product runtime code, human review decisions,
payment, reputation, blockchain integrations, frontend behavior, or agent
runtime redesign.

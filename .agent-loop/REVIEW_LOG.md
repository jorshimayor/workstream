Result: PASS after fixes; external review addressed; GitHub checks passed.

runtime selector, kept deterministic test behavior in explicit test-local
fakes only, and preserved OpenAI Agents SDK as the configured project setup
runtime boundary.

Result: PASS after fixes; external review addressed; GitHub checks passed.

Scope: duplicate guide-version conflict handling, guide-create source snapshot
capture, active-guide checker summary visibility, worker self-profile
onboarding through authenticated API, nullable worker identity response
coverage, and durable failed-pre-submit audit evidence without creating a
submission.

Next chunk: `WS-POL-001-11` should define and then implement local actor
identity and actor profile registries before the next Terminal Benchmark live
API drill.

Result: PASS after fixes from internal review and CodeRabbit. GitHub Agent
Gates, Backend, and CodeRabbit passed before merge.

Scope: local `ActorIdentity` and shared `ActorProfile` registry for verified
Flow actors, destructive removal of obsolete worker/reviewer profile stores,
explicit actor-registration dependency, worker profile activation through the
canonical worker endpoint, claim eligibility requiring verified worker token
role plus active worker profile, stale demo route cleanup, and Flow
issuer-plus-subject identity compatibility wording.

External review response: `.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-POL-001-submission-artifact-policy-foundation/reviews/WS-POL-001-11-external-review-response.md`

External review status: CodeRabbit comments triaged; valid findings fixed;
legacy-profile backfill request rejected because it contradicts the
no-backward-compatibility chunk decision.

Next gate: rerun the Terminal Benchmark live API drill through real HTTP calls
using `POST /api/v1/workers/me/profile`, then review findings before starting
the next product chunk.

Result: PASS after fixes from internal review and CodeRabbit. GitHub Agent
Gates, Backend, and CodeRabbit passed before merge.

Scope: worker-safe task work context, exact submission requirements, existing
worker task-read redaction, fail-closed locked-context validation, and
operator-only locked task provenance APIs.

External review status: CodeRabbit comments triaged; the valid test
maintainability nitpick was fixed; PR description warning was fixed by updating
the trust bundle and PR body.

Next gate: `WS-POL-001-14` remains inactive until the user explicitly starts it.
It should replace public submission lock wording with finalize semantics,
define system actor audit behavior, and rerun the Terminal Benchmark proof
through HTTP-visible lifecycle responses.

## WS-POL-001-14

Status: PR #79 open on 2026-07-08.

Branch: `codex/ws-pol-001-14-submission-finalize`

Reviewed implementation SHA: pending CodeRabbit-fix evidence commit

Required reviewer tracks:

- senior engineering

- security/auth

- architecture
- docs
- reuse/dedup
- test delta

Result: PASS after internal review fixes. CodeRabbit comments were triaged;
valid finalization, docs, and permissions-matrix findings were fixed. The broad
non-creator project-manager visibility suggestion was rejected because it
conflicts with the current scoped-operator security contract.

Scope: public submission handoff renamed to `finalize`, finalized response
fields replace public lock wording, pre-review checker execution is audited
under `workstream-system:pre-review-gate` with requester provenance, checker
and audit visibility use scoped operator authorization, and the API contract
plus Terminal Benchmark drills prove the lifecycle through HTTP-visible
responses.

External review response: `.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-POL-001-submission-artifact-policy-foundation/reviews/WS-POL-001-14-external-review-response.md`

External review status: CodeRabbit comments triaged; valid findings fixed;
GitHub checks must rerun after the fix push.

Next gate: push CodeRabbit fixes, wait for CodeRabbit and GitHub checks, then
wait for the user's explicit merge approval.

# Review Log

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Merged

PR #115 merged through explicit human approval as `8e1cde6`. Final GitHub
checks passed: Backend ran 949 tests at 82.77 percent global coverage, Agent
Gates passed, and CodeRabbit passed after all actionable comments were
addressed. The audit/delegation focused suite passed 11 tests at 94.55 percent
audit-subsystem coverage. AUTH-05A is complete; AUTH-05B remains inactive until
post-merge memory merges and the user gives a separate explicit start.
Senior engineering, docs, architecture, reuse, product/ops, QA/CI/test-delta,
and security/auth/privacy review passed for this memory-only reconciliation.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A CodeRabbit Response

CodeRabbit run `30676bdc-7525-4deb-8f9e-a87d42c64f92` produced four actionable
comments on PR #115. The response makes the inactive AUTH-05B verification
commands executable, replaces fragile positional event mapping with explicit
identity-link event keys, types the task audit fixture session, and replaces
misleading reused-agent names with AUTH-05A-specific review references. Focused
behavior, Ruff, stale authorization docs, Markdown links, and diff integrity
pass. Exact-SHA internal re-review passed at `ea16fd8` before publication of the
repair.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Semantic Scope Amendment

The human replaced AUTH-05A's numeric production-line ceiling with the approved
chunk contract as the controlling boundary. Allowed files, explicit non-goals,
acceptance criteria, behavior evidence, and required internal review now govern
scope. Readable SQL remains mandatory; AUTH-05B, route activation, permission
evaluation, and grant lifecycle implementation remain inactive.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Circuit Breaker Amendment Passed

The human-approved AUTH-05A-only 500-line inspection and 1000-line hard stop
passed all required exact-SHA reviewers at `611abfc`. Review confirmed the typed
and PostgreSQL privacy matrices must remain atomic, the incomplete 689-line
draft was discarded, SQL packing remains prohibited, focused behavior and 90
percent subsystem coverage gates remain, and AUTH-05B stays inactive. Bounded
runtime repair may resume.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Circuit Breaker Reopened

The first post-approval exact-registry dry run reached 689 changed non-comment
production lines before readable PostgreSQL parity was complete, crossing the
650 hard stop. The uncommitted runtime draft was discarded and the tree
returned to the 484-line approved implementation checkpoint. Splitting typed
and database enforcement into separately mergeable PRs would leave an
incomplete security boundary, so the user approved a 1000-line hard stop
with the existing 500-line inspection, 120-character migration line gate, and
no SQL packing. Runtime work remains paused for exact-SHA amendment review.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Repaired Contract Review Passed

The exact contract at `7cc6058` passed senior engineering, architecture,
product/ops, docs, reuse, QA, CI/test-delta, and security/privacy review. It
locks closed envelope/reason/fact registries, cross-field project integrity,
non-echoing Mapping/JSON admission, identical typed/direct-SQL behavior,
readable SQL, focused regressions, and the then-approved 500/650
circuit breaker. Bounded runtime repair may proceed; AUTH-05B remains inactive.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Repaired Contract Review Failed

Required review of contract `c93cf14` rejected implicit security registries.
Senior engineering, QA, and security agreed that exact event-to-reason,
event-to-fact, permission, denial, and reference matrices must be normative;
lexical bounds and "spec-derived" values were insufficient. Review also
required sanitized malformed-JSON handling, the two known checker regression
nodes, deterministic size/line checks, and symmetric additive test-delta
checks. The contract was repaired without runtime edits and requires a new
exact-SHA review.

Review of `2cd0fbe` then caught contradictory UUID rules for permission targets,
resource-ID nullability, admin role/scope compatibility, optional-versus-required
reason wording, and state-versus-decision fact meaning. It also required exact
added-plus-deleted size arithmetic and reuse of the repository's AST-aware test
weakening detector. Those contract defects were repaired before runtime work.
QA then found the AST command below the repository-root directory change; the
command was moved into its executable backend-relative position before final
contract review.
Senior review also required project-scoped grant facts to match the envelope
project, replacement facts to retain one scope, system-scope grant evidence to
omit project scope, and project resources to agree with the envelope project.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Contract Reopened By Exact-SHA Review

Exact-SHA review of implementation repair `6fbb1f8` closed append-only,
repository ownership, canonical actor-reference, and invalidation-cause
integrity concerns, but found valid remaining privacy and auditability gaps.
Arbitrary reason/fact strings could still impersonate opaque secrets, rejected
known values and non-dict mappings remained recoverable through structured
Pydantic errors, direct SQL did not enforce every typed token bound, and the
500-line ceiling had encouraged unreadable security SQL.

The repaired contract raises only AUTH-05A's ceiling to 650, prohibits
long-line packing, requires closed reason/fact registries, requires a
non-echoing pre-admission boundary for every Mapping, clarifies invalidation
cause integrity versus inactive idempotency replay, and requires typed/direct
SQL parity. No further runtime repair is permitted until required L1 contract
review passes; AUTH-05B remains inactive.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05A Preimplementation Review Passed

The repaired AUTH-05A contract passed required senior engineering,
QA/CI/test-delta, security/privacy, product/ops, architecture, docs, and reuse
review at `7a9023b`. The contract fixes migration ownership at `0018`, retains
the existing `audit_events` ledger and `AuditRepository` as sole persistence
owner, defines exact legacy/authority compatibility and bounded event shapes,
and requires unconditional normal-DML append-only triggers plus downgrade and
production-role custody proof. Bounded implementation and deterministic
evidence are active; AUTH-05B remains inactive.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-05 Plan Review Split Required

After AUTH-04B post-merge memory merged through PR #114 as `97cd0f5`, the user
explicitly started AUTH-05. Required L1 engineering, QA/CI, and
security/privacy/product plan review rejected the combined contract before any
runtime edit. Migration `0017` is already owned by AUTH-04B, dedicated audit and
authorization tests were absent, and shared audit custody plus idempotency and
invalidation were not credibly reviewable as one sub-500-line production diff.

The repaired plan splits AUTH-05 into 05A shared audit ownership/append-only
authority evidence on migration `0018`, then 05B idempotency/invalidation on
`0019`. Both retain caller-owned transactions, focused 90 percent subsystem
coverage, the global 78 percent CI floor, full reviewer fanout, and separate
human merge/start gates. No runtime implementation is active pending repaired
contract review.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Merged

PR #113 merged `WS-AUTH-001-04B` to `main` as `05a63c8` after final branch head
`94fb2fe` passed Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, all required internal
reviewers, and explicit human approval. Reviewed production head `67484b5`
contains the rate-control implementation; reviewed candidate `922778b`
contains the final implementation/test evidence before publication repair.

GitHub Backend passed 937 tests at 82.15 percent repository coverage and the
artifact-foundation coverage check at 91.07 percent. The current work is
post-merge memory only. AUTH-05 remains inactive pending this memory update
merge and a separate explicit user start.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Backend CI Repair

PR #113 Backend reached 82.12 percent repository coverage but failed because
the final AUTH-04B Alembic test left the shared isolated database at `base`.
Pytest's CI discovery order then entered `test_api_rate_controls.py` without
table `api_rate_control_counters`. The owning migration test now restores
Alembic `head` after its destructive cleanup. The exact failing
`test_alembic.py -> test_api_rate_controls.py` order is required repair proof;
no runtime, migration, coverage threshold, or workflow changes are permitted.
CodeRabbit posted one valid test-deduplication nit, now addressed through a
transaction-preserving shared insert helper. Its PR-description template
warning is addressed in the trust bundle; its docstring heuristic is superseded
by the passing repository-owned 95.8 percent docstring gate.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Ready PR Published

Ready PR #113 is open at
`https://github.com/Flow-Research/workstream/pull/113`. GitHub Backend, Agent
Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human review are the current gate. Publication
is not merge approval; AUTH-05 and artifact runtime remain inactive.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Internal Review Passed

All required tracks pass final SHA `922778b`; reviewed production SHA is
`67484b5`. Senior engineering, architecture, docs, reuse, QA/test, CI integrity,
test delta, security/auth, privacy/data, and product/ops found no remaining
blocker. The final test-only proof instruments the BaseSettings boundary and
would fail the prior recoverable-`SecretStr` implementation. Evidence and the
PR trust bundle are recorded under the AUTH initiative reviews directory.

Ready PR publication and external GitHub checks are the current gate. AUTH-05,
artifact runtime, and all route attachments remain inactive.

## 2026-07-14 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Exact-Head Review Repair

Required implementation review at `8f54fd9` passed QA, CI integrity, and test
delta with 72 fresh isolated PostgreSQL tests. Senior engineering and security
rejected PR publication because unrelated Pydantic validation errors could
retain the raw rate-control secret through structured error APIs. Security also
found that the canonical inactive artifact plan did not yet enforce D14's
central authorization prerequisite for adapter I/O.

The bounded repair removes the secret from Pydantic's public field graph before
all structured validation while preserving constructor, environment, and dotenv
loading. Regression tests inspect `errors()` and `json()` and cover
`model_validate`. The user-directed artifact ownership clarification amends only
the canonical ART plan and inactive chunk contract: mechanics may be developed
independently, but production dispatch requires AUTH-07 permissions, AUTH-09
service principals, exact resource authorization evidence, and never derives
authority from a credential or receipt. No artifact runtime or AUTH-05 behavior
is activated.

Initial repair evidence is 78 migration-inclusive isolated PostgreSQL behavior tests,
69 focused rate-control/config tests at 98 percent subsystem coverage, and the
real API contract E2E. Ruff, docstring coverage, stale authorization/artifact/
Workstream wording, Markdown links, loop memory, diff integrity, and all 36
agent-gate tests pass. The repaired production delta is 465 non-comment lines,
below the 500-line hard stop. Exact-SHA internal re-review is the current gate.

Exact-head review of `0b9d0fe` passed QA, CI integrity, and test delta, but
senior engineering and security found the same retention class in
`model_validate_json` and `model_validate_strings`; malformed JSON could also
retain its complete document. Senior engineering additionally found that the
manual secret source did not preserve BaseSettings' supported layered-dotenv
precedence. The final bounded repair covers those public entry points, rejects
malformed JSON with a constant non-retaining error, and resolves layered dotenv
files in order. Exact-SHA re-review remains mandatory before publication.

Final repair evidence adds 77 focused behavior tests at 98 percent subsystem
coverage, 56 direct configuration tests, and the exact AUTH-04B migration test
passing against a fresh isolated database. The production delta is 480
non-comment lines and remains below the 500-line hard stop. All static gates
continue to pass.

Exact-head review of `629d10c` found that rendered redaction was still weaker
than object-graph non-retention: Pydantic-version-dependent error input could
retain a recoverable `SecretStr`, malformed JSON remained reachable through
`JSONDecodeError.__context__`, and non-ASCII rejection chained a
`UnicodeEncodeError` containing the original key. The final privacy repair
passes only `None` into Pydantic, assigns the private validated key after
successful validation, and raises constant parse/decode failures outside catch
scopes. Tests traverse structured errors and complete exception cause/context
graphs rather than checking rendered output alone.

The object-graph repair passes 77 focused behavior tests at 97 percent
subsystem coverage. The final production delta is 480 non-comment lines, below
the 500-line hard stop.

QA passed runtime and CI integrity at `67484b5` but rejected the test proof:
the recursive helper did not traverse `ValidationError.errors()`, so rendered
redaction could hide a recoverable `SecretStr` on another Pydantic version. The
test-only repair now traverses the actual structured error objects and
instruments the `BaseSettings` boundary for mapping, JSON, and string-mapping
validation, asserting that only `None` crosses into Pydantic. This
deterministically fails the prior implementation that forwarded `SecretStr`.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Repaired Contract Passed

Implementation candidate `62dd18e` failed required exact-head review. Valid
findings were structured Pydantic secret retention, unpaired-surrogate identity
500s, a concurrent downgrade custody race, unsynchronized database tests,
incomplete downstream-rollback/session-open/prune/database-clock evidence, no
representative 0016 artifact row, and tests mistakenly placed in the prior
AUTH-04A file instead of the contract-owned rate-control file. One bounded
repair cycle moves the tests, closes each runtime/migration issue, adds exact
proof, and requires full-suite coverage plus exact-head re-review.

The repository-wide coverage run for repair head `2d70581` was interrupted by
the host shutdown on 2026-07-14 and produced no valid result. Under the current
repository rule and the chunk's laptop-capacity clause, local evidence must
prove the materially changed AUTH-04B subsystem remains at least 90 percent;
GitHub CI owns the unchanged repository-wide 78 percent gate. No interrupted
result is treated as evidence.

Required senior engineering, architecture, security/data, QA/test, CI-integrity,
test-delta, product/ops, docs, and reuse review passed exact repaired-contract
head `b5dceb1`. The second repair closed optional-secret, missing-database,
lock-order, oversized-identity, exact-setting/constraint, same-clock timestamp,
and cross-replica rotation gaps without runtime edits.

Bounded AUTH-04B implementation is authorized under the 350-line checkpoint and
500-line hard stop. Named dependencies remain unattached; AUTH-05 and all
product authority changes remain inactive.

`backend/tests/test_auth.py` was added as a test-only scope amendment after its
canonical-verification consumer allowlist correctly detected the new unattached
rate dependency. Only that expected inventory may change; auth runtime, routes,
compatibility behavior, and authority remain out of scope.

The implementation candidate passed 93 owned tests with 99 percent aggregate
coverage across config, dependency, model, repository, and service modules.
Real PostgreSQL proofs passed for atomic concurrency, durable denial, expiry,
saturation, pruning, exact schema, and guarded downgrade. The real API E2E and
all stale-wording, authorization-doc, artifact-contract, link, loop-state,
ruff, and diff checks pass. Required implementation review is the current gate.

The first production pass reached 408 changed non-comment lines. The mandatory
350-line checkpoint inspected every production path and froze scope to the
approved config, unattached dependencies, model, repository, service, model
registration, and `0017` migration. Ninety-two lines remain before the hard
stop; tests, docs, and evidence do not count.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Contract Repair Required

Required L1 preimplementation review rejected activation head `5ed410d` before
any runtime edit. The contract did not bind exact HMAC/secret bytes, overflow-
safe SQL, database-time boundaries, dedicated commit ownership, dependency
errors, real concurrency counts, transactional downgrade refusal, or expired
pseudonymous-row retention.

The repaired contract specifies canonical Base64 secret material, exact framed
HMAC input and bounds, `BYTEA` persistence guarded to 32 bytes, one clock-bound saturating
upsert, dedicated committed sessions, canonical 429/503 behavior, bounded
pruning plus operator cleanup, exact migration custody, real-ASGI/concurrency
proof, per-file 90 percent coverage, and additive test-delta evidence. Runtime
remains gated on exact-head re-review.

First repaired head `78e2170` resolved the original security/data ambiguities
but failed re-review on optional-secret syntax, missing-database mapping,
prune-before-upsert lock ordering, exact setting/constraint names, same-clock
`updated_at`, and local oversized-identity handling. This second repair is the
final in-place contract cycle for those classes; another failure stops and
replans before runtime code.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04B Started

PR #112 merged AUTH-04A post-merge memory to `main` as `7749f54` after Backend,
Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, required internal review, and explicit human approval
passed. The user then explicitly started `WS-AUTH-001-04B` in the isolated
worktree `/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-auth-001-04b` on branch
`codex/ws-auth-001-04b-postgres-rate-controls`.

AUTH-04B is L1/P1 authorization infrastructure. Its existing bounded contract
must pass required preimplementation review before runtime edits. AUTH-05,
POL-002-04, and QA implementation remain inactive.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04A Merged

PR #111 merged `WS-AUTH-001-04A` to `main` as `90c9a28` after final branch head
`36c4aa5` passed Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, all required internal
reviewers, and explicit human approval. Reviewed production head `cdcaf77`
contains the request/error implementation; reviewed candidate `4fd6db9`
contains only its additive behavior-test repairs and lifecycle evidence.

The current work is post-merge memory only. `WS-AUTH-001-04B` remains inactive
pending this memory update merge and a separate explicit user start. No AUTH
product implementation is active.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04A Internal Review Passed

All required implementation tracks pass on production SHA `cdcaf77`.
Test-validation head `47241cf` added one genuine real-ASGI scalar
validation-context branch assertion. A later test-only repair establishes and
restores logging capture after in-process Alembic configuration disables an
existing logger. Exact-head test-delta review confirmed identical production
blobs and retained every earlier result; the final reviewed test revision is
bound in the internal review evidence. Valid OpenAPI, response-header,
pre-response logging, real-ASGI behavior, inventory, compatibility, and memory
findings were repaired without rate controls, schema, grants, roles, routes, or
product-authority changes.

Focused evidence is 235 passing tests. Changed-file statement coverage is
98.08 percent for API controls, 90.82 percent for the application factory,
90.70 percent for auth dependencies, and 92.36 percent for the task router. The
API drill, isolated-runner lifecycle suite, Ruff, docstring threshold, stale
scans, Markdown links, Agent Gates, additive test-delta scan, and diff hygiene
pass. A complete isolated backend regression run exposed an Alembic logging
state leak after 114 passing tests; the affected real-ASGI test now establishes
and restores its logging capture precondition, and the exact failing order
passes. GitHub Backend owns the complete-suite rerun before merge. The official
separate whole-app coverage baseline remains 79.249908 percent; no replacement
is claimed.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04A Implementation Review Repair

The final repaired 04A contract passed both required preimplementation review
tracks at exact commit `f98bbfc` before runtime implementation began. The
implementation crossed the 350 non-comment production-line checkpoint; scope
was inspected and frozen to the approved request/error boundary, with no rate
control, schema migration, grant, role, or product-authority work. The durable
checkpoint record was omitted at that time and is repaired here. The candidate
remains below the 500-line hard stop; 04B and later chunks are inactive.

Required implementation review of exact head `2a129f4` passed security,
product authority, test-delta, CI-integrity, ASGI architecture, and shared
adapter-boundary checks, but rejected publication pending truthful per-route
OpenAPI, required response-header metadata, bounded pre-response failure
logging, complete real-ASGI error/schema/inventory proof, and synchronized loop
state. Those valid findings are in the first bounded repair cycle. A full-suite
run against `2a129f4` was stopped after findings made that exact-head evidence
obsolete; its partial output contained one unidentified failure and is not
completion evidence.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04 Split Required Before Implementation

Required L1 plan review rejected the combined request/error/rate-control parent
contract before any runtime edit. The valid findings required exact ASGI header
behavior and OpenAPI compatibility for request/error context, plus an
independent committed PostgreSQL transaction, database-time atomic upsert,
privacy-key framing, and migration proof for rate controls.

The parent is split into `WS-AUTH-001-04A` Request And Error Context and
`WS-AUTH-001-04B` PostgreSQL Rate Controls. Only 04A contract repair and
preimplementation re-review are active. 04B requires 04A merge/memory and a
separate explicit user start. No runtime implementation was written under the
failed combined plan.

The first split re-review passed senior/architecture/security/product/docs/reuse
at `f01427a` but QA/CI/test-delta required one more 04A contract repair: exact
per-branch errors and invalid-ID behavior, bounded validation shapes,
CI-equivalent isolated-runner/docstring proof, per-file coverage, and additive
test-delta evidence. Runtime implementation remains gated on that re-review.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-04 Started

PR #110 merged AUTH-03 post-merge memory to `main` as `1864867` after Backend,
Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, internal review, and explicit human approval passed.
The user then explicitly started `WS-AUTH-001-04` in the isolated worktree
`/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-auth-001-04` on branch
`codex/ws-auth-001-04-request-api-controls`.

AUTH-04 is L1/P1 authentication infrastructure. Discovery and required
preimplementation plan review must pass before runtime edits. AUTH-05,
POL-002-04, and all QA implementation chunks remain inactive.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-03 Merged

PR #109 merged `WS-AUTH-001-03` to `main` as `f06532e` after final branch head
`43ffbfe` passed Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, all required internal
reviewers, and explicit human approval. Reviewed code head `8c5334c` includes
external repair implementation `4923b67`, which preserves the primary CLI
failure and exit code when database cleanup also fails.

The current work is post-merge memory only. `WS-AUTH-001-04` remains proposed
and inactive pending this memory update merge and a separate explicit user
start. No AUTH product implementation is active.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-03 Internal Review Passed

Reviewed code SHA `8e2ae489834a3934d6ef507834139a1009dac2e6` passed senior
engineering, QA/test, security/auth, product/ops, architecture, CI integrity,
docs, reuse/dedup, and test-delta review. The first candidate's valid
worktree-custody, mutable-ORM, file-permission, canonical-byte, bounded-error,
JSON-size, issuer-validation, durability, and PostgreSQL-isolation findings were
repaired and re-reviewed with no remaining Critical, High, or Medium findings.

Focused evidence is 57 passing tests against isolated PostgreSQL with 92 percent
combined statement coverage for the new classifier and CLI. The isolated
database-runner lifecycle suite passes 16/16. Ruff, stale wording, stale
authorization docs, Markdown links, docstring coverage, and diff checks pass.
GitHub Backend CI must still provide the unchanged repository-wide
`--cov-fail-under=78` complete-suite proof before merge. AUTH-04 remains inactive.

## 2026-07-13 - WS-AUTH-001-03 Started After AUTH-02 Merge

PR #107 merged `WS-AUTH-001-02` to main as `060b780`. The user explicitly
started `WS-AUTH-001-03` while coverage work continues independently in its own
worktree. AUTH-03 runs on
`codex/ws-auth-001-03-legacy-actor-classification` at
`/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-auth-001-03`.

Preimplementation L1 plan review returned PASS WITH CONDITIONS. The conditions
are incorporated into the implementation boundary: no identity inference,
canonical UUIDv5 and exact issuer/subject matching, strict bounded JSON,
complete envelope and live-row checksums, privacy-bounded output/errors,
read-only repeatable-read database proof, crash-safe private no-overwrite file
publication, environment-variable-only future Alembic handoff, and genuine
behavior coverage at or above 90 percent for the new subsystem. No schema,
grant, role, actor-state, or later AUTH chunk changes are active.

## WS-QUAL-001-01B1

Status: BLOCKED. Candidate `7bfe3a0` has 496/500 lines and 66 focused behavior
tests. Senior engineering, QA, security, product/ops, architecture, CI, docs,
and reuse passed, but final test-delta review found three valid gaps after the
second semantic-integrity repair cycle.

Scope: read-only coverage policy core, parameterized contract behavior tests,
and truthful compute-floor documentation. No config, workflow, evidence, Git
publication logic, production behavior, or coverage-raising tests.

Next: review a smaller policy-core versus semantic-delta split and obtain
explicit user approval. No PR, 01B2, chunk 02, or AUTH resume is permitted.

User checkpoint: the user approved the proposed parser-core versus semantic-
delta split direction on 2026-07-12. Internal plan review must pass before
activating only 01B1A; 01B1B retains a later separate start checkpoint.

Split review result: PASS at `d1819873e5ac353da3963771f70dc2be13bc72f9`
across senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, product/ops, architecture,
CI integrity, docs, reuse/dedup, test delta, and circuit breaker. Only 01B1A is
active; 01B1B and 01B2 retain later checkpoints.

Implementation review result: BLOCKED at
`5af95751c554ad022128f78c9dd8c1190f38dec4`. Senior engineering,
architecture, reuse, CI integrity, test delta, product/ops, and docs passed.
QA and security found `pragma:nocover` and leading-space normalized duplicate
pytest-cov bypasses after the second parser repair cycle. No PR opened.

User direction: replan and fix the remaining coverage blockers while AUTH-02
continues independently in its existing worktree. Proposed replacement
`WS-QUAL-001-01B1A-R1` is limited to those two bypasses and preserves the full
400-line parser candidate cap.

R1 contract review: PASS at `7901de94f4391c107c52ea8733ac72ad34ceb069`
across all required tracks. Only R1 is active; any additional valid finding or
size above 400 stops and replans the replacement.

R1 implementation review: STOP at `c0fa4a2`. The two authorized fixes passed,
but senior architecture/reuse review found the approximate matcher rejected
comments the installed coverage runtime includes. R2 proposes canonical regex
reuse; no PR opened from R1.

R2 implementation review: PASS at code candidate `40ac7a9`. The installed
coverage.py 7.15.0 canonical grammar is reused directly, 58 focused behavior
tests pass, complete implementation scope is 398/400 lines, and every required
reviewer track passed with no remaining finding. Evidence/PR preparation is
active; 01B1B and 01B2 remain inactive.

R2 merge result: PR #105 merged to main as
`8a4182edb09970131aded73edf3428ac83fe60b9` on 2026-07-12. Post-merge memory is
the only active coverage work; 01B1B and 01B2 remain inactive.

R2 memory result: PR #106 merged as `6dccb8e`. The user then explicitly started
01B1B and confirmed coverage may run in parallel with AUTH in isolated
worktrees. Only 01B1B is active on the coverage branch; 01B2 remains inactive.

B1B implementation review: BLOCKED at `10dff4f`. Engineering accepted the
second repair, but QA/test-delta found valid lexical-shadow false positives and
a weakened local-lookalike `skipTest` expectation. The two-cycle circuit rule
stopped B1B at 223/300; B1B-R1 is proposed for exact lexical binding closure.

B1B-R1 contract review: PASS at `93e48b4` across senior engineering, QA/test,
security/auth, product/ops, architecture, CI integrity, docs, reuse/dedup, test
delta, and circuit breaker. The user directed coverage and AUTH to continue in
parallel; only B1B-R1 is active on the coverage branch.

B1B-R1 size checkpoint: STOPPED before implementation commit. The shared
resolver draft measured 282 lines before the required behavior matrix, above
the 270 checkpoint and incompatible with the 300 cap. The draft was discarded;
B1B-R2 is proposed with a measured 350-line cap and unchanged behavior scope.

B1B-R2 contract review: PASS at `8a5fc4a` across all ten required tracks. Its
measured 223/290/340/350 allocation, 310 checkpoint, lexical behavior, finite
repair rule, and B2/AUTH boundaries passed. R2 implementation is active.

B1B-R2 implementation review: BLOCKED at `d4cef1d`. Product/docs, security, and
CI passed; engineering, architecture, reuse, QA, test-delta, and circuit failed
on reproduced stdlib scope/control-flow gaps. At 348/350, valid fixes plus tests
could not fit. R3 is proposed around stdlib `symtable`; no in-place repair.

B1B-R3 contract review: PASS at `245ab58` across all ten required tracks.
Stdlib lexical ownership, ordinal scope pairing, full regression scope, the
348/420/480/500 allocation, and B2/AUTH boundaries passed. R3 is active.

B1B-R3 cycle-zero implementation review: FAIL at `10ca508` with 468/500 lines.
Cycle one must close independent control paths, chained ambiguity, exact store
targets, future annotations, and Python 3.12 inlined-comprehension semantics.
No repair starts until the clarified contract passes internal review.

B1B-R3 cycle-one plan review: STOPPED. QA accepted the clarified behavior, but
engineering found no credible way to fit complete repairs plus regressions in
32 lines. No executable repair was made. R4 is proposed with measured room.

B1B-R4 contract review: PASS at `ac2bcc6` across all ten required tracks. The
468/515/535/550 allocation and complete control/value-flow contract passed; R4
implementation is active.

B1B-R4 implementation review: BLOCKED at `06a6d61`. Review reproduced AST
replay/symtable corruption, missing loop-carried effects, target-load and unpack
bypasses, nested inline ownership, and optional comprehension mistakes. At
535/550 the fixes plus proof could not fit; B1B-R5 is proposed.

B1B-R5 contract review: PASS at `5672971` across all ten required tracks. The
single-consumption/cursor-neutral-summary boundary and 535/600/630/650
allocation passed; R5 implementation is active.

B1B-R5 implementation review: BLOCKED at `5f59f40`. Review reproduced
transitive loop/header, iterable target, exception/assignment ordering,
summary-pruning, and `except*` gaps. At 641/650 the repairs and missing proof
could not fit; B1B-R6 is proposed.

B1B-R6 contract review: PASS at `bfb2d8e` across all ten required tracks. The
fixed-point provenance/evaluation-order contract and 641/720/770/800 allocation
passed; R6 implementation is active.

B1B-R6 cycle-one implementation review: BLOCKED at `68174d1`. Review reproduced
comprehension/set/dict iterable provenance, structural consumption, nested
reachability, and class-global binding gaps. At 800/800 no valid repair and
proof fit; B1B-R7 is proposed.

B1B-R7 contract review: PASS at `f0134aa` across all ten required tracks. The
recursive iterable/structural consumption contract and 800/870/920/950
allocation passed; R7 implementation is active.

B1B-R7 cycle-zero review: FAIL at `26a4e6e`. Engineering and QA reproduced
lazy generator body effects, starred/dict-unpack and conditional provenance
bypasses, empty-dict reachability, and class-global boundary/sequencing gaps.

B1B-R7 cycle-one candidate: `a8e1e789f0421c35ecd6f23b9778379fb4b01156`.
The repair preserves lazy unknown-call genexpr bodies, recognizes structural
and known eager consumption, closes recursive unpack/conditional provenance,
walks literal-empty clauses, and makes declared class-global transfer
sequential and class-local. Proof is 254 focused tests, Ruff, `pip check`, diff
hygiene, and exactly 950/950 candidate lines. Fresh internal review is active.

B1B-R7 cycle-one review: FAIL at `a8e1e78`. Reviewers reproduced binding-blind
eager-call classification, missed comprehension/display/unpack/`yield from`
consumption, nested lazy over-consumption, empty-comprehension provenance, and
class control/import boundary leaks.

B1B-R7 cycle-two candidate: `5fcd9bb99a733fea9d6b05411ea26c4563375d61`.
One binding-aware consumption path now covers eager builtins, transparent
iterator wrappers, comprehensions, star displays/calls, sequence unpacking,
loops, and `yield from` without consuming nested yielded generators. Empty
comprehensions produce local provenance; class transfer keeps nested control
flow behind declared globals and qualifies framework imports by root. Proof is
278 focused tests, Ruff, and 920/950 candidate lines. Final review is active;
any additional valid finding stops R7 under its two-cycle rule.

B1B-R7 cycle-two review: STOP at `5fcd9bb`. Reviewers confirmed the prior
findings were repaired but reproduced transparent-wrapper provenance/emptiness,
qualified and async consumers, sequential builtin shadowing, relative-import
classification, class handler/guard and local-walrus effects, method consumers,
and argument-role precision gaps. The compressed two-case-per-line matrix was
also rejected as unreviewable. Under the approved two-cycle rule, do not repair
R7 again or publish it. Replan a replacement with a readable test budget.

B1B-R8 contract review: PASS at `9d72e42` across all ten required tracks after
clarifying monotone lexical ownership, simple alias closure, exact TestCase
syntax, merged-main restoration, readable matrices, and raw scope/size gates.

B1B-R8 implementation candidate:
`3acf57281da4638476e70d7ed118e24413c1d20b`. The R2-R7 interpreter delta was
removed and replaced by conservative framework-qualified syntax detection.
Pre-review proof: 117 focused tests, Ruff, `pip check`, self-applied delta
validation, stale wording/auth docs, loop memory, Markdown links, diff hygiene,
and 412/700 raw candidate lines pass. Internal implementation review is active.

B1B-R8 cycle-zero review: FAIL at `3acf572`. Reviewers reproduced unknown
direct-import false ownership, missed exact `unittest.case` chains, enclosing
shadow fallthrough, conflicting-owner overblocking, Python 3.12 type-parameter
scope mismatches, and nested TestCase receiver shadowing.

B1B-R8 cycle-one candidate:
`1a13beaaf968a00a19c64e702b33026283cf0d22`. Framework ownership now retains
sets of known paths, outer lexical bindings are barriers, exact unittest case
namespaces are preserved, unknown members remain local, PEP 695 function/class/
type-alias scopes are paired, and TestCase closures distinguish captured versus
local `self`. Proof: 140 focused tests and every deterministic gate pass at
498/700 raw lines. Internal re-review is active.

B1B-R8 cycle-one review: FAIL at `1a13bea`. Reviewers reproduced TypeVar-bound
child-scope mismatches, dotted aliased import overownership, nearer nonlocal
barrier fallthrough, missed comprehension/annotated targets, and omitted
vararg/kwarg annotations.

B1B-R8 cycle-two candidate:
`e2ac216a114bacb4115c7b44efa736e48cd500fb`. Bound/default child scopes are
paired, dotted aliases are exact, nonlocal lookup stops at the nearest lexical
binding, and every executable target and non-postponed argument annotation is
visited. Proof: 157 focused tests and every deterministic gate pass at 537/700
raw lines. Final internal review is active; another valid finding stops R8.

B1B-R8 final review: STOP at `e2ac216`. Engineering, security, product, docs,
architecture, reuse, and all deterministic 3.12 gates passed. Final QA
reproduced one supported-version defect: Python 3.11 gives list/set/dict
comprehensions child symtables, so nested clean lexical scopes can mismatch and
fail closed. The two-cycle rule forbids another R8 repair.

B1B-R9 proposal: introspect matching comprehension child tables so Python 3.11
enters them and Python 3.12+ uses inlined scope, with isolated dual-version
proof. No syntax-policy, Python-floor, workflow, dependency, B2, or application
change is permitted. Internal contract review is active.

B1B-R9 contract review: PASS at `4da0880` across all ten required tracks after
making the isolated Python 3.11 backend environment, interpreter assertion,
600-line cap, self-validator, and test-preservation rules executable.

B1B-R9 implementation candidate:
`5a971d80c38cbf856e9eee5bcd49fac6873c38c2`. Comprehension scope selection now
enters an optional stdlib list/set/dict child when present and otherwise uses
the containing inlined scope; genexpr remains required. The identical 161-test
matrix passes on isolated Python 3.11.15 and project Python 3.12.3. Ruff, pip,
self-validation, scope, wording, memory, links, diff hygiene, and 546/600 raw
lines pass. Internal implementation review is active.

B1B-R9 cycle-zero review: FAIL at `5a971d8`. Reviewers found one related
compatibility class: nested synthetic inline-comprehension frames masked module
ownership on 3.12+, and Python 3.13 exposes renamed public PEP 695 symtable
types.

B1B-R9 cycle-one candidate:
`a5395c173741ee584312e5b69e70676092ce9c46`. Synthetic versus real
comprehension frames are distinguished by selected table identity, and child
matching accepts both supported public symtable type families without version
branches. Identical 165-test matrices pass on Python 3.11.15, 3.12.3, and
3.13.3. Every deterministic gate passes at 553/600 raw lines. Final internal
review is active; another valid finding stops R9.

B1B-R9 final review: STOP at `a5395c1`. The comprehension repair and identical
165-test Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 matrices passed, but Python 3.13 TypeVar bounds
and defaults share identical public child identifiers. Separate field keys can
select the first child twice when nested scope shapes differ. R9's one-repair
rule forbids another edit.

B1B-R10 proposal: consume public TypeVar children through one shared AST-order
ordinal while retaining distinct legacy families, with mixed bound/default
proof on Python 3.13 and invalid-syntax fail-closed expectations on 3.11/3.12.
No comprehension, policy, config, dependency, workflow, or application change
is permitted. Internal contract review is active.

B1B-R10 contract review: PASS at `c42a67a` across all required tracks after
requiring successful `analyze_python` traversal before owned outcomes can pass.

B1B-R10 implementation candidate:
`15d0b80e776f5be12cacc5dbe5226ffe3992dcfd`. Public `type variable` bound and
default children now share one AST-order ordinal; legacy families remain
distinct. Clean, skip, and raises-deletion mixed-shape fixtures cover both
orders across generic functions, classes, and type aliases. Identical 171-test
matrices pass on Python 3.11.15, 3.12.3, and 3.13.3. Every deterministic gate
passes at 577/620 raw lines. All required implementation tracks passed. The
final evidence review found only structured-evidence and stale-memory defects;
those are repaired before PR publication without changing reviewed code.

B1B-R10 publication: ready PR #108 published at
`https://github.com/Flow-Research/workstream/pull/108`. External checks and
human review are active; B2 remains inactive.

B1B-R10 external review: CodeRabbit's provenance comment was already repaired.
Three further valid comments require truthful nine-track/circuit-breaker
wording, R7-R9 supersession state, and fail-closed deleted-assertion behavior
when base-source retrieval fails. The bounded repair adds a direct regression
test and must pass deterministic proof plus internal review before publication.

B1B-R10 merge: PR #108 merged to `main` as `5c47aba`. Its reviewed syntax-only
test-integrity policy is now integrated; 01B2 and coverage chunk 02 remain
inactive pending their separate explicit start gates.

AUTH-03 external review: CodeRabbit reported five lifecycle/evidence wording
issues and one cleanup precedence bug. Repair implementation `4923b67`
addresses all six, passes 59 focused behavior tests at 90.12 percent combined
coverage, and passed all required internal reviewer tracks. Its raw-exception
logging nitpick is rejected because confidential identity, database, or path
values must not enter logs. Final evidence binding and GitHub checks remain.

## WS-QUAL-001-01B

Status: user started the chunk after PR #104 merged. Its repaired L1 contract
passed plan review at `7a16ee4`, but implementation hit the hard circuit breaker
at 480/500 lines before required config, CI, runbook, and negative proof.

Scope: coverage policy, contract tests, configured initial floor, canonical CI
validation, baseline evidence, and runbook only. No production or coverage-
raising behavior tests.

Result: executable draft and partial candidate run were stopped and cleaned up.
A policy-core versus baseline/CI split is proposed for internal and explicit
human approval. Do not start either split chunk or chunk 02.

Next gate update before PR #81: the accepted no-DB Terminal Benchmark live API
drill from `main` exposed an agent-derived submission artifact policy
self-conflict during policy derivation. Corrective chunk `WS-POL-001-15`
hardened the derivation contract and reran that live API drill successfully.

PR #81 merged into `main` as `b1a9851a5fe00580b704fe42bdeb511638dfe688`.

Result: PASS after internal review, CodeRabbit, Agent Gates, and Backend checks.

Scope: hardened the OpenAI Agents SDK submission artifact policy derivation
prompt so it produces a project-level worker submission contract, avoids
required/forbidden self-conflicts, avoids secret-like required fields, and
requires exact safe relative artifact paths. Server-side default forbidden
artifact validation remains fail-closed.

Required reviewer tracks:

- senior engineering

Result: PASS after plan repairs. The reviewed planning tree preserves the

staged local-grant cutover, keeps `/api/v1`, protects intermediate-release
operability, and leaves all runtime implementation inactive.

Scope: imported and hash-bound eight Workstream reference files; added the
WS-AUTH-001 intent, discovery, decisions, risks, plan, source manifest, status,
16 implementation chunk contracts, and durable WS-POL-002 pause. D1-D3 are

Reviewed planning SHA: `5739e1d6fc8df0fa620bd007c45e370530ac8d12`.

Result: PASS after internal plan repair and a CI-discovered PDF binary-diff
repair. Agent Gates and Backend passed. CodeRabbit produced a walkthrough with
no actionable findings, then its final check was cancelled when the PR closed.

Scope: merged the immutable reference-spec archive and the complete
WS-AUTH-001 planning package with 16 bounded implementation chunks. No runtime,
schema, dependency, frontend, review, contribution, or compensation behavior
was implemented.

Evidence: `.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-AUTH-001-workstream-authorization-service/reviews/WS-AUTH-001-PLAN-internal-review-evidence.md`

Next gate: explicit durable human approval of D4-D10 and a separate
`WS-AUTH-001-01` start signal. Create a fresh worktree/branch from the latest
merged `main`; do not implement chunk 01 in the planning worktree.

## 2026-07-11 - WS-AUTH-001-01 Started

The user explicitly approved D4-D10 and started only `WS-AUTH-001-01` by saying
"ok start" after the planning and post-merge memory PRs merged.

Branch: `codex/ws-auth-001-01-adopt-authorization-baseline`

Worktree: `/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-auth-001-01`

Scope: authorization ADR, canonical repository documentation, deterministic
stale-authorization documentation gate, operations runbook, and durable loop
state. Backend runtime, migrations, tests, dependencies, review, contribution,
compensation, frontend, and later authorization chunks remain inactive.

Next gate: implement and verify only the WS-AUTH-001-01 contract, run all
required internal reviewer tracks, prepare the trust bundle, and stop for human
review.

## 2026-07-11 - WS-AUTH-001-02 Started; Dependency Gate Open

The user explicitly started `WS-AUTH-001-02` by saying "now we start" after the
WS-AUTH-001-01 post-merge memory was merged.

Initial plan review found no safe standard-library or current production
dependency path for asymmetric JOSE verification and policy-controlled async
HTTP. D12 therefore proposes adding `PyJWT[crypto]>=2.13,<3.0` and moving the
existing `httpx>=0.27,<1.0` requirement from development to base dependencies.
The review also required explicit network lifecycle, cache concurrency,
introspection, compatibility, metrics, and negative-test contracts; those
details were added to the chunk contract.

Final preimplementation plan-review result after repair:

- senior engineering: PASS
- architecture: PASS
- reuse/dedup: PASS
- QA/test: PASS
- CI integrity: PASS
- test delta: PASS
- docs: PASS
- security/auth: PASS
- product/ops: PASS

Current gate: no dependency or runtime implementation change until the user
explicitly approves D12.

## 2026-07-11 - WS-AUTH-001-02 D12 Approved

The user explicitly approved D12 by replying "ok apporeved" after the repaired
preimplementation plan passed every required review track. This approval
authorizes adding `PyJWT[crypto]>=2.13,<3.0` and moving
`httpx>=0.27,<1.0` from development to base dependencies for this chunk only.

Current gate: bounded `WS-AUTH-001-02` implementation and evidence. Do not
start `WS-AUTH-001-03`.

During full-suite verification, the approved removal of email from canonical
and compatibility auth contexts left one stale actor test expecting the dev
token email to be persisted and returned. The chunk contract now explicitly
allows `backend/tests/test_actors.py` only for that expectation correction; no
actor service, persistence schema, or actor API implementation entered scope.
Two task integration assertions carried the same stale expectation, so
`backend/tests/test_tasks.py` is also allowed only for null identity-metadata
expectations at the auth registration boundary.

Required implementation review then identified that production startup
validation belongs to `backend/app/main.py`; contract amendment A1 records that
exact app-factory boundary before the repair edit. The amendment and all three
test-only expectation files remain subject to the repeated full reviewer
fanout. This is recorded as a process correction rather than represented as
part of the original preimplementation allowlist.

Final evidence-bound branch head: `2b8c2a0`.

Result: PASS after internal review, CodeRabbit repair, cancellation ownership
hardening, and a CI-order fixture repair. Agent Gates, Backend, and CodeRabbit
passed on the final head. The merge adds the provider-neutral immutable
artifact domain and local development adapter; it does not add public artifact
APIs, Flow Node integration, or product cutovers.

remains inactive pending a separate explicit user start.

## 2026-07-12 - WS-AUTH-001-02 Resumed In Parallel Worktree

The user explicitly authorized `WS-AUTH-001-02` to resume in
`/home/abiorh/flow/workstream-auth-001-02` while coverage work continues in its
separate worktree. This replaces the prior coverage-dependent pause but does
not weaken AUTH evidence, internal review, or publication gates.

Current gate: integrate current `main`, rerun deterministic implementation
proof, run all required implementation reviewer tracks, repair valid findings,
and prepare review evidence before any push or PR. Do not start
`WS-AUTH-001-03`.

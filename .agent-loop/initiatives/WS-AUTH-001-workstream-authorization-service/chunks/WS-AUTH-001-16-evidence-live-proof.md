# Chunk Contract: WS-AUTH-001-16 - Conformance, Observability, And Live API Proof

## Status

Proposed final gate. It cannot start until every protected feature surface
already merged has its matching AUTH activation, while every registered action
without merged feature behavior still denies as planned.

## Parent initiative

`WS-AUTH-001` - Workstream Authorization Service

## Goal

Verify authority-event/idempotency completeness, finish privacy and
observability, run exhaustive permission/concurrency tests, and produce an
API-visible live authorization drill.

## Why this chunk exists

The initiative is not complete until immediate revocation, separation of
duties, resource scope, bootstrap safety, and absence of direct database edits
are proven end to end.

## Acceptance criteria

- Authority events contain version, correlation/request ID, acting/target
  actor, matched grant, project, reason, idempotency key, and bounded state.
- No authority history is backfilled to compensate for a missing earlier
  event/idempotency schema; gaps stop the initiative.
- Tokens, raw claims, JWKS bodies, secrets, and unnecessary PII are absent from
  logs, errors, audit, and committed evidence.
- Table-driven tests cover every permission role/scope allow and deny case.
- Exact conformance proves all 74 PermissionIds and derives the trusted-main
  ActionId total at execution time. REV-REG contributes exactly four planned
  actions and review-evidence registration contributes exactly one planned
  action, in either order; both contribute zero active actions. It proves every
  ActionId-to-PermissionId mapping, exact AUTH owner, availability, and static
  service-matrix row, with no feature-valued activation owner remaining.
- A generated conformance manifest covers every protected `/api/v1` route and
  asynchronous command with exactly one primary registered action, canonical
  resource type, and owning feature loader/composer. Unknown or missing
  permissions, resources, guards, or declarations fail closed; the manifest is
  evidence generated from the registry and surface declarations, not a second
  policy source.
- PostgreSQL tests cover provisioning, grant, final-admin, revocation/command,
  and idempotency races.
- Prepared-mutation tests prove AUTH-first lock order, session/action-bound
  single use, final feature fact recomposition, one evaluation, one caller-owned
  commit, and complete rollback on authority loss, evidence/participant/commit
  failure, timeout, and cancellation.
- Live drill proves bootstrap, scoped admin grants, separate submitter,
  reviewer, and adjudicator grants and independent revocation,
  admin/contributor separation, same-token revocation, suspension/reactivation,
  service handling, cross-project denial, and final-admin safety.
- Adjudicator grant behavior is visible and independently revocable while all
  adjudication actions remain unavailable until WS-REV defines the lifecycle
  and AUTH activates exact adjudication actions; admin authority alone cannot
  submit, review, or adjudicate.
- One actor/project holds all three roles concurrently; issue/revoke/regrant is
  proven independently in every direction, duplicate/concurrent issue constraints
  hold, each revocation preserves the other two and all admin grants, and no
  `both`, replacement field/event/reason, audit, idempotency, schema, or current
  PostgreSQL validator path remains.
- Submitter revocation alone reaches task-assignment reconciliation; reviewer
  revocation creates only the REV obligation; adjudicator invalidation remains
  dormant until its lifecycle activates. Wrong-grant submit/review/adjudication
  and same-token/transaction-time authority-loss cases deny.
- Fixed-service proof covers exact token/link/profile/identity/matrix/action
  admission, human/service isolation, every cross-service denial, planned-action
  denial, and transaction revalidation. Missing provisioned rows deny without
  preventing application startup.
- Every activated feature action proves immutable feature-manifest-before-AUTH
  ordering, real-kernel unavailable behavior before activation, exact
  availability delta after activation, and no alternate feature writer.
- When review evidence binding is registered, proof includes distinct human and
  binding-service decisions/evidence, exact lock order, and one transaction.
  When `review.decision` is active, REV plus the flush-only CON participant
  commit once or roll back together with no ART call or contribution fallback.
- Live drill implements the complete adopted specification sequence, including
  Finance and Audit Authority capability separation, Project Manager inability
  to review by admin role alone, self-grant/self-revoke denials, full authorized
  audit export, database constraint evidence, duplicate-profile absence,
  request/correlation/error and actor/grant IDs, and proof that no direct
  database authority edit occurred.
- The verifier/JWKS/introspection metrics implemented at the adapter boundary in
  chunk 02 are verified end to end. Initiative metrics also cover first
  access/conflicts, actor/link state, authorization decisions/denials,
  admin/project grants, invalidation backlog, and bootstrap attempts with
  bounded labels.
- Alerts cover sustained verification failure, unusable JWKS cache, repeated
  bootstrap/final-admin denial attempts, unusual grant mutation rate,
  invalidation backlog, and abnormal provisioning conflicts. The runbook names
  alert owner, diagnosis, recovery, escalation, and evidence retention.
- Existing full backend suite, API contract drill, lint, docstrings, docs gates,
  and internal review evidence pass.
- No dependency, test, coverage, lint, or configuration gate is weakened. Any
  production dependency change requires separately recorded explicit human
  approval before modification.
- No obsolete token-role authorization remains in runtime code.
- Initiative memory records proof and does not start `WS-POL-002-04` or another
  initiative without a separate explicit user signal.

## Required reviewers

- senior engineering
- QA/test
- security/auth
- product/ops
- architecture
- CI integrity
- docs
- reuse/dedup
- test delta

## Human review focus

Review the live evidence chain, same-token revocation, final-admin race proof,
permission matrix completeness, privacy, and confirmation that later initiatives
were not started.

## Stop conditions

Stop if real proof requires production secrets/data, direct SQL authority edits,
test weakening, an unapproved production dependency, or starting
review/compensation/WS-POL implementation.

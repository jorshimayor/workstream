# Chunk Contract: WS-AUTH-001-14 - Submission, Checker, And Audit Visibility Cutover

## Parent initiative

`WS-AUTH-001` - Workstream Authorization Service

## Goal

Move submission precheck/create/read/finalize, checker trigger/read, checker
contributor projections, and task audit visibility to registered permissions and
canonical task/project/assignment guards.

## Why this chunk exists

Submission/checker authorization shares locked-task provenance and contributor
redaction rules but is separable from task claim and system-worker execution.

## Acceptance criteria

- Exact-project submitter/both grant plus active assignment is required to
  create submissions; admin roles alone cannot submit.
- Contributor artifact staging behavior and resource facts remain owned by
  `WS-ART-001-04A`; this chunk neither activates upload actions nor provides
  direct provider access. Dedicated AUTH custodians activate the actions only
  after hidden ART behavior merges. Submission authority never implies
  artifact-storage authority.
- Submission creation authorizes against its existing active assignment; every
  migrated submission/checker/audit route declares one primary registered
  action against a feature-owned canonical target and keeps artifact bytes and
  unnecessary actor data outside `ResourceContext` and authority evidence.
- Generated OpenAPI/command manifest-delta tests prove every protected
  submission/checker/audit surface migrated here has exactly one active
  `ActionId` declaration.
- Manager repair/checker triggers require covered project permissions.
- Project Manager repair uses covered `project.task.manage`; Operator recovery
  uses distinct `operations.submission_gate.repair` and
  `operations.checker.retry` permissions. Each path requires a reason and
  records matched grant/permission without granting general project authority.
- AUTH-07A migration `0021` already gives
  `operations.submission_gate.repair` and `operations.checker.retry`
  PermissionId/ActionId typed and PostgreSQL parity as planned metadata. This
  chunk promotes each action only with its feature resource composer, Operator
  candidate, guards, surface declaration, reason, evidence, and behavior tests.
  Migration `0026` owns submission/checker Contributor-field schema changes
  only; it does not change the permission or action registry.
- Contributor reads preserve ownership, hidden-result redaction, and concealed
  not-found behavior.
- Audit reads expose only permission-appropriate bounded fields before counts.
- Operator `operations.status.read` receives only the bounded submission/checker
  operational projection required for recovery. Audit Authority `audit.read`
  receives covered task/submission/checker evidence-chain reads. Both are
  read-only, filter before counts/cursors, redact artifact bytes and unnecessary
  actor data, conceal unauthorized resources, and have mutation-denial tests.
- Revocation/suspension applies on next request and sensitive commit recheck.
- No migrated operation uses token roles or `require_any_role()`.
- Submission removes the final `LegacyWorkflowEligibilityCompatibility`
  consumer; eligibility is the exact-project submitter/both grant plus active
  assignment and lifecycle guards.
- Submission ownership and attestation plus checker-result visibility fields
  use `contributor_id`, `contributor_attestation`, `contributor_message`,
  `contributor_suggested_fix`, `contributor_evidence_refs`, and
  `contributor_visible` across persistence, models, schemas, services, runner
  contracts, audit payloads, and tests. Submission-policy JSON and derivation
  contracts use `contributor_facing_fix`. Migration `0026` preserves all values,
  supports downgrade, and removes legacy storage/property names without public
  API aliases.
- With the final consumer removed, the legacy `/api/v1/workers/me/profile`
  route, typed-profile activation service/schema, and token-role workflow
  observation fields plus the now-unused compatibility adapter/allowlist are
  removed in the same chunk. Route-removal,
  stale-reference, fresh-database intake, and full API drill tests prove no
  intermediate release requires deleted metadata.
- For a replacement assignee on a durable `needs_revision` obligation,
  submission creation must consume that obligation atomically, link the
  superseded submission, and include replay for every prior high/medium finding
  under the prepared locked/rebased revision context. Missing linkage, context,
  or replay is denied without clearing or weakening the obligation. Tests cover
  successful replacement submission, each missing requirement, transaction
  failure/rollback, retry, and preservation of prior immutable attempts.
- Full backend suite and API contract drill pass.

## Required reviewers

- senior engineering
- QA/test
- security/auth
- product/ops
- architecture
- CI integrity
- docs
- reuse/dedup
- test delta

## Human review focus

Review assignment ownership, manager repair scope, checker-result redaction,
audit disclosure, and unchanged checker routing.

## Stop conditions

Stop if authorization cutover requires changing checker outcomes, task states,
or review lifecycle behavior.

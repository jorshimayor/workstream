# Chunk Contract: WS-AUTH-001-09 - Actor State, Identity Revocation, And Service Actors

## Parent initiative

`WS-AUTH-001` - Workstream Authorization Service

## Goal

Implement actor suspension/reactivation/deactivation, identity-link
revoke/reactivate, controlled service-actor provisioning, and their audited,
idempotent authority invalidation behavior.

## Why this chunk exists

Local role grants are incomplete without immediate actor/link invalidation and
controlled service identity resolution.

## Approved plan reference

## Acceptance criteria

- Suspension blocks later business mutations and is reversible.
- Deactivation is terminal and preserves history.
- Identity-link revocation blocks the same issuer subject immediately; link
  reactivation restores the same profile without duplication.
- Identity-link revocation for an effective Access Administrator takes the same
  `AuthorityControl FOR UPDATE` lock as grant/profile removal.
- Self-suspension/deactivation and final-admin loss are denied under the shared
  authority lock.
- Unknown services are denied without persistence.
- Access Administrator can pre-provision a service profile/link with reason.
- Artifact system principals are fixed service identities, never human/admin
  grants. Their eventual permissions are drawn only from the closed registry.
  This chunk provisions the identities but does not attach them to artifact
  call sites; each owning WS-ART chunk activates its exact service action after
  the feature resource facts and guards exist.
- The artifact service-principal allowlist is limited to
  `artifact.verification.execute`, `artifact.pending_work.scan`,
  `artifact.put_attempt.resolve`, `artifact.upload_session.expire`,
  `artifact.binding.create`, `artifact.guide_source.read`,
  `artifact.checker_input.materialize`, and `artifact.checker_output.write`.
  Operator reads/retry and contributor ingest/upload actions are excluded.
- The fixed identities are `workstream.artifact.verifier`,
  `workstream.artifact.put_resolver`, `workstream.artifact.scheduler`,
  `workstream.artifact.binding`, `workstream.artifact.guide_reader`,
  `workstream.artifact.materializer`, and
  `workstream.artifact.checker_output`. Their exact ActionId assignments are
  the closed service-identity matrix in `docs/spec_authorization_service.md`;
  no principal receives the union of the allowlist.
- AUTH-09 assigns only exact registered ActionIds from that table. Generic
  PermissionIds such as `artifact.binding.create` and
  `artifact.checker_input.materialize` are never executable action names and
  are never granted as an implicit union of their mapped actions. A planned
  assignment remains inert until its owning WS-ART chunk activates the action's
  canonical resource composer, guards, surface, and behavior proof.
- Startup parity tests fail closed when any fixed artifact service actor,
  identity link, action registration, PermissionId mapping, or exact assignment
  is missing or extra. Negative tests prove each identity is denied all artifact
  actions outside its matrix row.
- Agent and Space subjects remain unsupported and unpersisted.
- Every mutation is idempotent, reasoned, and audited without token material.
- Mixed concurrent link-revoke, grant-revoke, suspend, and deactivate attempts
  leave at least one authenticatable effective Access Administrator.
- `GET /api/v1/admin/actors`, actor detail, suspend/reactivate/deactivate,
  actor identity-link read, identity-link revoke/reactivate, and service actor
  create/list/detail routes from the adopted contract have
  allow/deny/privacy/rate-limit/replay tests.
- Every protected actor/link/service route declares one active `ActionId` mapped
  to the existing actor profile, identity-link, or service-provision permission
  and its canonically loaded target. Generated manifest-delta tests prove every
  surface introduced here has exactly one declaration.
- Suspension/link-revocation events explicitly require consuming lifecycle
  reconciliation; task assignment consumption belongs to chunk 13 and review
  lease consumption remains deferred to WS-REV-001.

- test delta

## Human review focus

Review state-machine terminality, service separation, invalidation timing, and
preservation of historical records.

## Stop conditions

Stop if a consuming adapter authority must be invented or if a service must be
treated as a human/admin to make tests pass.

# Chunk Contract: WS-AUTH-001-03 - Legacy Actor Classification Preflight

## Parent initiative

`WS-AUTH-001` - Workstream Authorization Service

## Goal

Provide the supported, versioned, dry-run-first workflow that classifies every
legacy actor identity before canonical actor migration without inference or
manual SQL.

## Why this chunk exists

Current rows have issuer and subject but no trustworthy `subject_kind`.
Migration cannot safely guess human versus service.

## Approved plan reference

## Acceptance criteria

- Manifest schema is versioned JSON with exact legacy actor ID, canonical
  issuer, opaque subject, and `subject_kind`.
- Unknown fields/kinds, invalid UUIDs, duplicate actor or issuer/subject,
  mismatches, missing database rows, and stale extra rows are rejected.
- Dry-run is the default and produces a checksum-bound, privacy-bounded report.
- The tool emits one canonical immutable envelope to an operator-selected path
  outside the repository. The envelope contains schema version, sorted actor
  classifications, source row-set SHA-256, manifest SHA-256, generated-at, and
  a non-secret database binding identifier.
- The row-set digest covers the complete sorted legacy identity projection
  needed by migration. Any row change after export changes the digest.
- Alembic later locates the envelope only through
  `WORKSTREAM_LEGACY_ACTOR_CLASSIFICATION_FILE`, verifies canonical checksum,
  recomputes the live row-set digest inside the migration transaction, and
  aborts on TOCTOU mismatch, missing/extra rows, or database-binding mismatch.
- Envelope generation is deterministic and idempotent and never writes grants
  or actor state.
- Empty registries need no manifest and produce an explicit empty proof.
- Runbook defines owner, secure manifest custody, dry-run/export sequence,
  evidence retention, environment-specific secure path, Alembic handoff,
  failure recovery, rollback boundary, and post-migration deletion of the
  classification file after its checksum/version are recorded durably.
- Tests prove deterministic output and fail-closed mismatch behavior.

## Human review focus

Review that classification is explicit, complete, checksum-bound,
privacy-bounded, and unusable as a grant or ad hoc migration bypass.

## Stop conditions

Stop if any existing subject kind must be inferred or if the only workable path
requires manual SQL or production identity-provider payloads.

## Activation

The user explicitly started this chunk after PR #107 merged as `060b780` on
2026-07-13. L1 preimplementation plan review returned PASS WITH CONDITIONS; the
conditions require strict Pydantic 2 schema-version-one models, canonical UUIDv5
derivation, complete envelope checksums, privacy-bounded failures, read-only
repeatable-read proof, crash-safe no-overwrite publication, and focused
subsystem coverage of at least 90 percent while preserving the global baseline.

## Implementation review status

Implementation SHA `8e2ae489834a3934d6ef507834139a1009dac2e6`
and reviewed lifecycle revision `a70b89c91a8950eabaa750e340d4f853529d66f0`
passed the required internal reviews. Focused isolated-PostgreSQL behavior proof
is 57 passing tests with 92 percent combined statement coverage for the new
classifier and CLI. The isolated database-runner lifecycle suite passes 16/16.
PR #109 external checks and explicit human review are the current gate; AUTH-04
remains inactive.

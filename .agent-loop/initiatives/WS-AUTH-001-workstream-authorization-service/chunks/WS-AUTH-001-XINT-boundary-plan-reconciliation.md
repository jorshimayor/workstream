# Chunk Contract: WS-AUTH-001-XINT — Lifecycle Boundary Plan Reconciliation

## Parent initiative

`WS-AUTH-001` - Workstream Authorization Service

## Goal

Reconcile the remaining AUTH plan with merged PR #139 and the canonical
`WS-XINT-001` AUTH/ART/REV/CON handoffs before any affected runtime work
continues.

## Why this chunk exists

The cross-initiative reconciliation changed the meaning of `ActionOwner`,
replaced the combined project-role model, required a prepared mutation
protocol, and made fixed-service admission a prerequisite rather than feature
authority. The existing AUTH plan reflects parts of those decisions but does
not yet provide complete, executable chunk custody.

## Risk class

L1 / P1 planning and security-contract correction.

## Not allowed

```text
backend runtime, migration, schema, route, worker, or test implementation
ActionId or PermissionId registration
ActionOwner or ActionAvailability runtime changes
service provisioning or feature action activation
editing immutable historical migrations or archived reference specifications
starting AUTH-09B, ART, REV, CON, or POL runtime work
resolving PR #132 by restoring pre-XINT planning text
```

## Acceptance criteria

- The plan records PR #139 and treats all four merged XINT handoffs as
  authoritative inputs.
- PR #132's seven fixed identities, eleven static matrix actions, and migration
  `0023` remain valid, while its planning conflicts are assigned to a separate
  exact-main convergence and re-review step.
- `ActionOwner` means only an exact AUTH activation custodian. All 25 current
  ART and 19 current REV mappings have explicit availability-neutral transfer
  chunks and exact future AUTH activation chunks.
- The four proposed REV actions and the ART review-evidence binding action stay
  unregistered until their owning features publish complete typed contracts;
  their registration and activation are separate gates.
- AUTH gains a bounded prepared-mutation foundation before project and review
  mutations consume it.
- AUTH-10 cleanly removes current `both` and replacement evidence from typed
  and PostgreSQL validation without rewriting historical migrations or silently
  converting rows.
- AUTH-10 through AUTH-16 state role-specific invalidation, wrong-grant denial,
  idempotency, migration, conformance, and fixed-service proof exactly.
- Every future implementation chunk names one merge-intent file, required
  reviewers, deterministic proof, and a stop condition.
- The amendment changes no runtime and declares no automatic successor start.

- product/ops
- architecture
- CI integrity
- docs
- reuse/dedup

## Human review focus

Review whether authority custody, transaction ownership, service identity,
project-role independence, migration order, and downstream activation gates are
complete without moving ART, REV, or CON behavior into AUTH.

## Stop conditions

Stop if reconciliation requires inventing a foreign-domain resource contract,
activating a feature action, changing runtime, or overwriting the merged XINT
contract to preserve older AUTH wording.

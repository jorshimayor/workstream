## Deterministic Evidence

- Fresh isolated PostgreSQL focused evidence passed 312 tests in 2,626.88
  seconds after two repaired expectation failures were rerun successfully.
- Ten direct repair tests pass for inactive observation suppression and real
  lock-time lifecycle, identity, matrix, and availability drift denial.
- Four isolated PostgreSQL ART admission tests pass after the trusted-main
  integration repair, proving exact human and checker-service context
  composition while preserving locked identity validation.
- The real isolated HTTP API contract drill passed, including unprovisioned,
  provisioned, suspended, reactivated, revoked-link, and repaired-link service
  states.
- Ruff, 90.3 percent repository docstring coverage, both stale scanners,
  Markdown links, diff integrity, and all 88 agent gates pass.
- No workflow, dependency manifest, Alembic revision, migration allocation,
  skip, xfail, test deletion, coverage exclusion, or threshold reduction was
  introduced. Migration `0028` remains owned by the independent ART work.
- GitHub Backend is the mandatory hosted proof for the unchanged 78 percent
  repository-wide floor and the persistent 90 percent actor and authorization
  subsystem reports. The intentionally stopped local full run is not claimed
  as evidence.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS AFTER FIXES | none | Inactive subjects no longer stage observations; maintainability is sound. |
| QA/test | PASS AFTER FIXES | none | Real revalidation proves lifecycle, identity, matrix, and availability drift denial. |
| security/auth | PASS | none | Exact identity resolution, fail-closed dispatch, rollback, and evidence privacy hold. |
| product/ops | PASS | none | No feature action, human workflow, payment, review, or reputation behavior activates. |
| architecture | PASS | none | Typed AUTH boundaries and the reusable actor lock seam remain closed. |
| CI integrity | PASS | none | Hosted full coverage retains every existing threshold and failure gate. |
| docs | PASS AFTER FIXES | none | Operations now describe present central AUTH admission and legacy rejection. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS | none | Existing lookup, lock, matrix, timestamp, and evidence paths are reused. |
| test delta | PASS | none | No weakened, removed, skipped, or xfailed test; integration proof complements mocks. |

## Findings Resolved

Valid findings addressed: yes

Open sub-agent sessions: none

Candidate `65ee8887` staged service observations before lifecycle denial and
tested drift through an overly shallow callback. Repaired candidate `881ac7fc`
gates observations on active rows, fails malformed locked reconstruction
closed, and directly proves lifecycle, identity, matrix, and availability
drift. Documentation candidate `d859af3d` removes one stale pre-09E operations
sentence and corrects the dependency docstring. All required tracks pass with
no remaining blocking finding. Trusted main then advanced through ART PR #154.
Security review rejected merge candidate `d2d974eb` because ART admission still
checked the former concrete `AuthorizationContext`; integrated candidate
`98376fd1` repairs that boundary with exact membership in the two closed
concrete context types and passes all nine tracks after the stale timing docs
were corrected.

## Remaining Risk And Gate

GitHub Backend, Agent Gates, external review, and explicit human review remain.
No feature action is active. ART owns migration `0028`; this chunk adds no
migration, and its same-initiative successor still requires a separate explicit
start after this PR and signed memory, subject to its own contract prerequisites.

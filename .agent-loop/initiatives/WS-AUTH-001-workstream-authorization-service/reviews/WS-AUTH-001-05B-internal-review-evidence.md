## Deterministic Evidence

- Authorization, shared-audit, and exact migration-node suite: 26 passed in
  47.11 seconds.
- The new `app.modules.authorization` subsystem reached 96.88 percent coverage,
  above the required 90 percent gate.
- Migration custody separately passed its upgrade/downgrade, immutable-row,
  database-time, pre-0019 orphan, and observed concurrent-lock proof.
- Isolated database runner suite: 16 passed in 148.55 seconds.
- Ruff passed for backend application, tests, scripts, and migration code.
- Docstring coverage passed at 95.3 percent overall.
- Stale Workstream, authorization, and artifact contract scans passed. Changed
  Markdown links and `git diff --check` passed.
- No dependency, workflow, coverage threshold, skip, exclusion, or package
  script changed.
- Repository-wide isolated suite reached approximately 94 percent with no
  failure before it was intentionally interrupted after two hours on a
  four-core host at load average 13.7. This is not recorded as a pass; GitHub
  Backend remains the authoritative full-suite and 78 percent global gate.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS | none | Exact request-to-result binding and transaction ownership pass. |
| qa/test | PASS | none | Ten operations plus replacement, concurrency, rollback, migration, and privacy behavior pass. |
| security/auth | PASS | none | Actor isolation, non-retention, claim integrity, and database bypass controls pass. |
| product/ops | PASS | none | Mutation, replay, mismatch, and invalidation semantics pass without route activation. |
| architecture | PASS | none | Shared audit ownership and caller-owned transaction boundaries remain intact. |
| ci integrity | PASS | none | CI policy, thresholds, dependencies, and exclusions are unchanged. |
| docs | PASS | none | Architecture and operations documentation match the implementation. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS | none | Existing hash and shared audit abstractions are reused. |
| test delta | PASS | none | Existing audit assertions were adapted for mandatory idempotency linkage and positive operation coverage was strengthened; no coverage was weakened. |

## Findings Resolved

Review repair closed committed-record evidence injection, incomplete
entity/target/cause/context linkage, request-A/result-B substitution,
caller-selected mismatch scope, nonexistent grant-resource labels, rejected
Pydantic diagnostic retention, malformed-Unicode exception retention, weak
actor-kind isolation proof, missing positive operation parity, immutable-row
proof gaps, and downgrade/writer race proof.

Valid findings addressed: yes

Open sub-agent sessions: none

## Remaining Gate

GitHub Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human merge approval
remain pending. `WS-AUTH-001-06` remains inactive.

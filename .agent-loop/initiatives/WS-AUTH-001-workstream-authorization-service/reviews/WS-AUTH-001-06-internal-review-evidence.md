## Deterministic Evidence

- Actor subsystem branch coverage reached 90.1031 percent across 804
  statements and 166 branches, above the required 90 percent gate.
- Final actor and legacy-classification coverage run: 83 passed in 706.29
  seconds, including synchronized compatibility activation, rollback, privacy,
  exact-anchor, and lifecycle behavior.
- External-review database proof passed six migration, concurrency, and
  lifecycle scenarios together; the repaired role-without-submit-access case
  then passed separately against the integrated branch.
- Real Postgres API contract passed through migration `0020`, actor
  provisioning, response privacy, compatibility projection, task
  claim/start/submission, and authorization denials.
- Ruff passed for backend application, tests, migration, and API contract code.
- Stale Workstream wording, stale authorization documentation, changed Markdown
  links, and `git diff --check` passed.
- All 71 integrated engineering-loop agent-gate tests passed, and the schema-v2
  merge intent resolves the exact same-initiative AUTH-07 successor.
- No workflow, dependency, coverage threshold, skip, exclusion, or package
  script changed. GitHub Backend remains authoritative for the repository-wide
  78 percent floor; the multi-hour full suite was not repeated locally.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS | none | Transaction ownership, identity resolution, compatibility boundaries, and failure mapping pass. |
| qa/test | PASS | none | Provisioning, idempotency, migration, rollback, rate-control, and legacy behavior are covered. |
| security/auth | PASS | none | Issuer-subject identity, non-human denial, bounded claims, privacy, and zero-write failures pass. |
| product/ops | PASS | none | Contributor semantics and bounded legacy submitter compatibility match the approved lifecycle. |
| architecture | PASS | none | Canonical actor ownership and shared dependency boundaries pass; accepted low operational risks are documented. |
| ci integrity | PASS | none | CI policy, thresholds, dependencies, and exclusions are unchanged. |
| docs | PASS | none | Deployment, rollback, privacy, bounds, and compatibility documentation match runtime behavior. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS | none | Shared rate-control and actor failure mapping replace duplicate route behavior. |
| test delta | PASS | none | New assertions exercise meaningful behavior without skips, xfails, or weakened expectations. |

## Findings Resolved

Review repair closed stale eligibility on assigned task start, operator-override
regression, deactivated-profile access, non-human zero-write proof, rate-control
unavailability, mid-audit rollback, repeated-access timestamp behavior,
idempotent and serialized compatibility activation, migration ID/downgrade
gaps, invalid-row privacy, exact-anchor validation, lifecycle affordance drift,
fixture cleanup safety, duplicate error mapping, and human-facing legacy
terminology.

Valid findings addressed: yes

Open sub-agent sessions: none

## Remaining Gate

GitHub Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human merge approval
remain pending. `WS-AUTH-001-07` must not start automatically.

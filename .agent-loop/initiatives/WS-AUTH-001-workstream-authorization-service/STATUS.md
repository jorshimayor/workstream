# Status: WS-AUTH-001 - Workstream Authorization Service

## Current status

Planning merged through PR #91 as
`ad6d6444e497b76d7cb925f3b0999ed4b74a3dac` after required internal reviews,
Agent Gates, and Backend passed. CodeRabbit produced a walkthrough with no
actionable findings, then its final check was cancelled when the PR closed.
D4-D10 were explicitly approved and WS-AUTH-001-01 was started by the user on
2026-07-11. The final branch head `b5217e1` passed required internal reviews,
Agent Gates, Backend, and CodeRabbit, then merged through PR #93 as `772af1d` on
2026-07-11. The user separately started `WS-AUTH-001-02` on 2026-07-11. Its
preimplementation plan review passed, and the user explicitly approved D12's
exact production dependency changes. After a coverage-priority pause, the user
explicitly resumed AUTH in its separate worktree on 2026-07-12. Bounded runtime
implementation and repair review are complete on reviewed code SHA `47dd5a7`;
all required internal tracks passed and PR #107 merged as `060b780` on
2026-07-13. The user then explicitly started `WS-AUTH-001-03`. Its L1
preimplementation plan review passed with conditions. Bounded implementation,
repair, and all required internal reviewer tracks now pass on reviewed code SHA
`8c5334c`, including external repair implementation `4923b67`. PR #108 merged
to `main` as `5c47aba`; that main revision is integrated into AUTH, whose prior
lifecycle reconciliation was reviewed at `a70b89c`. Backend, Agent Gates, and
CodeRabbit passed on final branch head `43ffbfe`, then explicit human approval
merged PR #109 to `main` as `f06532e` on 2026-07-13. AUTH-03 post-merge memory
merged through PR #110 as `1864867`. The user then explicitly started AUTH-04.
Required L1 plan review rejected the combined request/error/rate-control scope
before runtime edits and required a split. AUTH-04A's final repaired contract
passed both required preimplementation reviews at `f98bbfc`. Implementation
candidate `2a129f4` then entered required internal review. Valid OpenAPI,
logging, behavior-proof, and lifecycle-evidence findings were repaired; all
required tracks pass on production SHA `cdcaf77`, and final test-only head
`4fd6db9` passed exact-head confirmation for the additive scalar-context and
logging-state behavior-test repairs plus lifecycle evidence.
Backend, Agent Gates, and CodeRabbit passed on final branch head `36c4aa5`, then
explicit human approval merged PR #111 to `main` as `90c9a28` on 2026-07-13.
AUTH-04A post-merge memory merged through PR #112 as `7749f54`. The user then
explicitly started AUTH-04B; its required L1 preimplementation review rejected
the first activated contract before runtime edits. The second
repaired contract passed all required tracks at `b5dceb1`; bounded runtime
implementation and deterministic evidence are complete, and the candidate is
internally approved at final SHA `922778b`; reviewed production SHA is
`67484b5`. The Backend CI isolation repair passed exact review at `4fb846c`.
Final branch head `94fb2fe` passed Backend, Agent Gates, and CodeRabbit, then
explicit human approval merged PR #113 to `main` as `05a63c8` on 2026-07-14.
AUTH-04B post-merge memory merged through PR #114 as `97cd0f5`. The user then
explicitly started AUTH-05. Required L1 plan review rejected the combined
audit/idempotency contract before runtime edits and required children 05A and
05B. The first repaired AUTH-05A contract passed at `7a9023b`, but exact-SHA
implementation review demonstrated that closed privacy registries and readable
typed/SQL parity require a larger readable contract. The repaired contract
passed at `7cc6058`, but numeric hard stops repeatedly interrupted the atomic
typed/database parity boundary. The human replaced the line cap with AUTH-05A's
semantic scope, acceptance criteria, behavior evidence, and review gates;
runtime repair, deterministic evidence, and required reviews then completed.
Backend passed 949 tests at 82.77 percent global coverage, Agent Gates and
CodeRabbit passed, and explicit human approval merged PR #115 as `8e1cde6` on
2026-07-14. AUTH-05A post-merge memory then merged through PR #116 as `ab49b73`.
The user requested action/resource catalogue reconciliation before AUTH-05B.
That docs-only work passed required internal reviews, Backend, Agent Gates, and
CodeRabbit; explicit human approval merged PR #117 as `4c5d4fc` on 2026-07-14.
Its post-merge memory merged through PR #118 as `eba7e2b`. AUTH-05B's repaired
L1 plan, implementation, repair, focused evidence, and required review tracks
passed before explicit human approval merged PR #119 as `ad71c7e`.
AUTH-06 then established canonical actor profiles and identity links. Its
runtime, migration, compatibility, privacy, and API evidence passed required
internal and external checks; explicit human approval merged PR #124 as
`f599551` on 2026-07-15. Signed automated memory stopped with AUTH-07 requiring
a separate start. The user explicitly started AUTH-07 on 2026-07-15; discovery
and required L1 plan review are complete. The repaired AUTH-07A contract passed
all required tracks at `beb85ac`; implementation, repair, deterministic
evidence, and required internal review pass at `478a819`. The canonical
review/revision amendment then passed exact-head review at `160af8a`, with 74
PermissionIds and 50 planned ActionIds.
That review rejected the combined AUTH-07 contract before runtime edits because
grant-backed/project APIs preceded their authority sources and the audit/API
ownership files were incomplete. Parent AUTH-07 is now split into 07A catalogue
and audit parity, followed by 07B kernel and actor self-action cutover. AUTH-07A
merged through PR #126 as `e9d72a1`; signed schema-v2 state verified that merge,
and the user explicitly started AUTH-07B. Its required L1 preimplementation
review passed with conditions. Implementation, deterministic evidence, review
repair, and all required internal reviewer tracks passed, then PR #130 merged
as `90eca12`. Signed schema-v2 memory verified that merge and stopped at
AUTH-08. The user explicitly started AUTH-08. Its inherited L1 contract failed
initial security/architecture, QA/product, and senior/CI/docs review before
runtime edits. The repaired contract passed all required preimplementation
tracks at `cbe7c6c`; bounded AUTH-08 implementation later merged through PR #131
as `aa0fdcd`. AUTH-09 was split before runtime implementation. PR #140 merged
the authoritative AUTH XINT reconciliation as `d541521`; PR #132 then merged
AUTH-09A as `299363a`. Signed memory stopped, and the user explicitly started
AUTH-09B from that trusted head. Its bounded implementation, external-review
repair, coverage repair, and required checks passed before PR #143 merged as
`053242b`. Signed memory stopped, and the user explicitly started AUTH-09C.
Its bounded implementation and external repair passed before PR #146 merged as
`0ffdabf`; signed schema-v2 memory at `eeb3dc2` recorded completion and stopped.
The user explicitly started AUTH-09D. Required L1 preimplementation review
rejected the combined lifecycle contract before runtime edits, so the parent is
split into 09D-A and 09D-B. AUTH-09D-A repaired implementation and deterministic
proof pass at `b025460`; exact-head internal review remains. No service caller or
feature action is active.

## Active planning chunk

None. `WS-AUTH-001-XINT` merged through PR #140.

## Active implementation chunk

`WS-AUTH-001-09D-A` - Profile Lifecycle And Evidence Repair. Exact-SHA
preimplementation review passed at `7f941a5`; the three profile lifecycle
routes, migration `0026`, and repaired deterministic proof pass at `b025460`. Exact-head
internal review is the current gate.

Feature-gated registration and activation chunks are enumerated in
`CHUNK_MAP.md` and `ACTIVATION_CUSTODY.md`. They remain inactive until exact
merged feature manifests and separate human starts exist.

## Blockers

AUTH-09C has no remaining blocker. PR #146 merged as `0ffdabf` and signed
memory passed at `eeb3dc2`. AUTH-09D-A's repaired contract passed required L1
preimplementation review at `7f941a5`; no planning blocker remains. It must not
add identity-link mutation, service grants, dynamic assignments,
token-role authority, service admission, or feature-action activation.

The four proposed REV lifecycle actions and review-evidence binding action are
blocked on complete feature-owned typed manifests. REV fixed services are also
blocked on exact identity-to-ActionId contracts. These are deliberate
registration gates, not reasons to weaken AUTH or invent catch-all authority.

AUTH-10 through AUTH-15 require exact action enumeration before each starts.
AUTH-10 additionally owns the clean cut across the typed `ProjectRole`, audit,
and idempotency contracts plus the current PostgreSQL validators recreated by
migration `0022`, removing obsolete `ProjectRole.BOTH` and replacement evidence.
AUTH-09B owns migration `0024` for service-link verification timestamp
semantics, ART owns `0025` for the ArtifactStore v2 clean cut, and AUTH-09D-A
owns `0026` for lifecycle evidence and profile reactivation provenance repair.
AUTH-10 through AUTH-15 own shifted migrations `0027` through `0032` for their
action/evidence parity.

AUTH-05A and CAT post-merge memory have no remaining blocker and are merged.
The combined AUTH-05 contract
was rejected before runtime changes because shared audit evidence and
idempotency/invalidation were not reviewable as one L1 change. AUTH-05A owns
migration `0018`; merged AUTH-05B owns migration `0019`. Non-test
operators must later supply explicit classification evidence rather than
inferred kinds before the owning canonical actor migration.

The proposed external catalogue cannot be adopted as a normative handoff: it
conflicts with `/api/v1`, AUTH-05A's merged 49-identifier persisted audit base,
current project and artifact models, and staged domain ownership. All 74
permission identifiers are approved, including
`operations.task.start_override`, `operations.submission_gate.repair`, and
`operations.checker.retry`; AUTH-07A gives those recovery identifiers exact
typed/PostgreSQL parity while AUTH-13/14 retain action activation and feature
behavior ownership. `WS-AUTH-001-CAT` retains only safe registry/conformance
rules. This is a scope decision, not an AUTH-05B runtime
blocker. PR #118, AUTH-05B PR #119, and AUTH-06 PR #124 are merged. AUTH-07 has
an explicit user start. Required review split it before runtime implementation;
the repaired 07A contract passed all required tracks at `beb85ac`; implementation
and repair passed at `478a819`, and the review/revision amendment passed at
`160af8a`. AUTH-07A then merged through PR #126. AUTH-07B has an explicit user
start and no prerequisite blocker; POL-002-04 remains inactive pending its own
authorization prerequisites and explicit start.

AUTH-04B review evidence and its PR trust bundle are recorded at
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-04B-internal-review-evidence.md` and
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-04B-pr-trust-bundle.md`.

AUTH-04A review evidence and its PR trust bundle are recorded at
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-04A-internal-review-evidence.md` and
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-04A-pr-trust-bundle.md`.

AUTH-03 review evidence and its PR trust bundle are recorded at
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-03-internal-review-evidence.md` and
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-03-pr-trust-bundle.md`. Prior AUTH-02 evidence remains at
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-02-internal-review-evidence.md` and
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-02-pr-trust-bundle.md`.

Production issuer configuration and legacy non-test actor classification are
future implementation/live-proof inputs and are tracked explicitly in
`DISCOVERY.md` and chunk stop conditions.

The user accepted D13 on 2026-07-13: the target provider-neutral boundary is
`IdentityIssuerVerifier`, extending the shared `ExternalServiceAdapter`
convention and using its typed factory. The current verifier/configuration
names remain functional migration inputs. The atomic AUTH adoption requires
its own reviewed chunk after `WS-ART-001-02A1` installs the shared foundation;
it is not part of the size-capped AUTH-04A request/error implementation.

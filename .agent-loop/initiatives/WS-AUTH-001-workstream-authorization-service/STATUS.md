# Status: WS-AUTH-001 - Workstream Authorization Service

## Current status

Planning merged through PR #91 as
`ad6d6444e497b76d7cb925f3b0999ed4b74a3dac` after required internal reviews,
Agent Gates, and Backend passed. CodeRabbit produced a walkthrough with no
actionable findings, then its final check was cancelled when the PR closed.
D4-D10 were explicitly approved and WS-AUTH-001-01 was started by the user on
2026-07-11. The final branch head `b5217e1` passed required internal reviews,
Agent Gates, Backend, and CodeRabbit, then merged through PR #93 as `772af1d` on
2026-07-11. The user separately started `WS-AUTH-001-02` on 2026-07-11. Its
preimplementation plan review passed, and the user explicitly approved D12's
exact production dependency changes. After a coverage-priority pause, the user
explicitly resumed AUTH in its separate worktree on 2026-07-12. Bounded runtime
implementation and repair review are complete on reviewed code SHA `47dd5a7`;
all required internal tracks passed and PR #107 merged as `060b780` on
2026-07-13. The user then explicitly started `WS-AUTH-001-03`. Its L1
preimplementation plan review passed with conditions, and bounded implementation
and behavior evidence are active in the dedicated AUTH-03 worktree.

## Blockers

No current blocker. AUTH-03 requires no production identity payloads for
deterministic implementation; non-test operators must later supply explicit
classification evidence rather than inferred kinds.

AUTH-03 review evidence and its PR trust bundle will be recorded after the
deterministic evidence gate and required internal reviewer fanout. Prior AUTH-02
evidence remains at `reviews/WS-AUTH-001-02-internal-review-evidence.md` and
`reviews/WS-AUTH-001-02-pr-trust-bundle.md`.

Production issuer configuration and legacy non-test actor classification are
future implementation/live-proof inputs and are tracked explicitly in
`DISCOVERY.md` and chunk stop conditions.

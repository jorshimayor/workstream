# Chunk Map: WS-AUTH-001 - Workstream Authorization Service

## Rule

Only one chunk may be active at a time. Do not start the next chunk until the
current chunk is implemented, verified, internally reviewed, externally
reviewed, merged by explicit human approval, followed by a memory update, and
stopped.

## Feature-gated registration and activation chunks

These identifiers are exact future gates, not executable chunk contracts or
automatic successors. AUTH materializes each contract only after its immutable
feature manifest exists, then requires a separate explicit start.

## Boundary notes

- Chunk 02 authenticates tokens but grants no product authority.
- Chunk 03 provides a supported classification gate before schema migration.
- Parent chunk 04 was split before implementation. Chunk 04A establishes
  request/correlation and additive error compatibility; chunk 04B later owns
  durable PostgreSQL rate controls and its migration.
- Parent chunk 05 was split before implementation. Chunk 05A owns shared audit
  schema/writer custody and append-only authority evidence; chunk 05B owns
  idempotency and typed invalidation orchestration.
- The docs-only catalogue reconciliation between 05A and 05B adopts a staged
  typed action/resource registry for future chunks without changing the merged
  permission/audit catalogue or starting runtime implementation.
- Chunk 06 establishes canonical actor resolution while preserving only the
  enumerated non-authoritative legacy workflow-eligibility consumers required
  for intermediate-release operability.
- Parent chunk 07 was split before runtime implementation. Chunk 07A owns the
  closed permission/action catalogue and action-aware audit parity; chunk 07B
  owns the minimal deny-by-default kernel and actor self-action cutover.
- PR #139 merged the WS-XINT boundary contract. `WS-AUTH-001-XINT` is the
  planning-only AUTH owner response; it changes no runtime.
- Chunks 08-10 establish local grant truth before product cutover. Parent chunk
  09 is split into 09A through 09E. The separately reviewed contributor
  foundation follows 09D-B so REV can consume canonical human attribution
  without waiting for the full AUTH-13/14 cutovers. It changes no authority or
  lifecycle behavior. 09E separately admits fixed services without entering
  human grant evaluation. ART/REV custody
  transfer follows 09E and changes only owner metadata and availability-neutral
  parity. PREP then establishes AUTH-first
  locking and caller-owned commit before sensitive product/review mutations.
- Chunks 11-15 migrate bounded complete product/system surfaces.
- Artifact upload, read, retention, release/delete, replication, integrity, and
  reconciliation remain mechanically owned by the artifact subsystem but must
  receive centralized AUTH decisions. Chunk 07A owns the permission/action
  registry, chunk 07B owns the central kernel, chunk 08 owns Operator grant
  definitions, chunk 09A owns the exact planned static matrix, and 09B owns
  controlled fixed service provisioning. AUTH-09E owns fixed service runtime
  admission. Each WS-ART feature chunk owns only
  hidden canonical resource facts, guards, surface declarations, decision calls,
  behavior, and tests. Dedicated AUTH custodians integrate evaluators and alone
  change availability after the matching ART behavior merges. AUTH-12, AUTH-14,
  and AUTH-15 are not alternate artifact activation paths. WS-ART-001-02D starts
  only after AUTH-09A through AUTH-09E and custody registration, then remains
  hidden until the internal and Operator AUTH activation checkpoints pass.
  Later ART and REV chunks use the same sequence. Exact mappings, registration
  counts, service-extension gates, and activation proof live in
  `ACTIVATION_CUSTODY.md`.
- Chunk 16 proves the complete initiative after every protected surface already
  merged has its matching AUTH activation and every unimplemented registered
  action still denies as planned. It does not backfill missing audit or
  idempotency evidence.
- `WS-POL-002-03` merged separately through PR #90 as `a7aa474`. This initiative
  does not own it; post-merge memory completed through PR #94. `WS-POL-002-04`
  remains inactive until the relevant project authorization cutover is complete
  and the user explicitly starts it.

## Stop condition

AUTH-03 post-merge memory merged through PR #110 as `1864867`. The user
explicitly started parent AUTH-04. Required plan review split it before runtime
implementation. AUTH-04A merged through PR #111 as `90c9a28`, and its
post-merge memory merged through PR #112 as `7749f54`. The user explicitly
started AUTH-04B. Its repaired contract passed at `b5dceb1`; bounded
implementation and all required internal review tracks passed, and PR #113
merged as `05a63c8` after Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human
approval passed. AUTH-04B post-merge memory then merged through PR #114 as
`97cd0f5`, and the user explicitly started AUTH-05. Required plan review
rejected the combined contract before runtime edits and required 05A/05B.
The first 05A implementation review proved the original numeric ceiling
incompatible with readable typed/database privacy parity. Repaired 05A contract
review passed at `7cc6058`; the user subsequently replaced the line cap with
the semantic AUTH-05A boundary. Required reviews and checks passed, and explicit
human approval merged PR #115 as `8e1cde6` on 2026-07-14, followed by merged
post-merge memory. `WS-AUTH-001-CAT` then merged through PR #117 as `4c5d4fc`
after Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human approval passed. The
CAT post-merge memory merged through PR #118 as `eba7e2b`; AUTH-05B then merged
through PR #119 as `ad71c7e`. AUTH-06 merged through PR #124 as `f599551`, its
signed automated memory completed, and the user explicitly started AUTH-07.
Required L1 review rejected the combined contract before runtime edits and
required 07A/07B. AUTH-07B merged through PR #130 as `90eca12`; AUTH-08 merged
through PR #131 as `aa0fdcd`. Parent AUTH-09 was split before implementation.
PR #140 merged the required XINT planning reconciliation as `d541521`. PR #132
then merged seven identities, eleven static matrix memberships, eight planned
actions, and migration `0023` as `299363a`; signed memory stopped. The user
explicitly started AUTH-09B. PR #143 merged it as `053242b`; signed memory
stopped, and the user explicitly started AUTH-09C. PR #146 merged it as
`0ffdabf`; signed memory at `eeb3dc2` stopped. The user explicitly started
AUTH-09D. Required preimplementation review rejected the combined lifecycle
contract before runtime edits, so it was split into 09D-A and 09D-B. PR #148
merged 09D-A as `99ae4c9`; signed memory `cf8a3e8` stopped and named 09D-B. The
user explicitly started 09D-B; exact contract `9ec6390b` passed required L1
review. PR #152 merged it as `93dd392`; signed memory `912a6254` passed and
stopped. The user explicitly started the contributor foundation. Its first L1
review rejected the underspecified contract before runtime edits; exact repair
and rereview are current. AUTH-09E and POL-002-04 remain inactive pending their
own gates and explicit starts.

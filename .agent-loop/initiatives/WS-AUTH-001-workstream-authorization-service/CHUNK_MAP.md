# Chunk Map: WS-AUTH-001 - Workstream Authorization Service

## Rule

Only one chunk may be active at a time. Do not start the next chunk until the
current chunk is implemented, verified, internally reviewed, externally
reviewed, merged by explicit human approval, followed by a memory update, and
stopped.

## Boundary notes

- Chunk 02 authenticates tokens but grants no product authority.
- Chunk 03 provides a supported classification gate before schema migration.
- Parent chunk 04 was split before implementation. Chunk 04A establishes
  request/correlation and additive error compatibility; chunk 04B later owns
  durable PostgreSQL rate controls and its migration.
- Parent chunk 05 was split before implementation. Chunk 05A owns shared audit
  schema/writer custody and append-only authority evidence; chunk 05B owns
  idempotency and typed invalidation orchestration.
- The docs-only catalogue reconciliation between 05A and 05B adopts a staged
  typed action/resource registry for future chunks without changing the merged
  permission/audit catalogue or starting runtime implementation.
- Chunk 06 establishes canonical actor resolution while preserving only the
  enumerated non-authoritative legacy workflow-eligibility consumers required
  for intermediate-release operability.
- Parent chunk 07 was split before runtime implementation. Chunk 07A owns the
  closed permission/action catalogue and action-aware audit parity; chunk 07B
  owns the minimal deny-by-default kernel and actor self-action cutover.
- Parent chunk 09 was split before runtime implementation. Chunk 09A adds a
  fixed `service_identity` to service ActorProfiles and one closed static
  service-action matrix without routes or active actions. Chunk 09B provisions
  fixed service principals; 09C owns bounded actor/link reads; 09D owns actor
  and link lifecycle mutations plus final-admin concurrency.
- Chunks 08-10 establish local grant and actor truth before product cutover.
- Chunks 11-15 migrate bounded complete product/system surfaces.
- Artifact upload, read, retention, release/delete, replication, integrity, and
  reconciliation remain mechanically owned by the artifact subsystem but must
  receive centralized AUTH decisions. Chunk 07A owns the permission/action
  registry, chunk 07B owns the central kernel, chunk 08 owns Operator grant
  definitions, chunk 09A owns the static service matrix, 09B owns fixed
  artifact service principals, and each WS-ART feature chunk owns the canonical resource facts,
  guards, surface declarations, and behavior tests for the exact artifact
  actions it activates. AUTH-12, AUTH-14, and AUTH-15 do not pre-activate or
  attach artifact actions. WS-ART-001-02D starts only after AUTH-09B and activates
  its bounded Operator and internal-service surfaces through the central kernel;
  later WS-ART chunks do the same for their own resources. AUTH-16 proves no
  bypass remains.
- Chunk 16 proves the complete initiative; it does not backfill missing audit
  or idempotency evidence.
- `WS-POL-002-03` merged separately through PR #90 as `a7aa474`. This initiative
  does not own it; post-merge memory completed through PR #94. `WS-POL-002-04`
  remains inactive until the relevant project authorization cutover is complete
  and the user explicitly starts it.

## Stop condition

AUTH-03 post-merge memory merged through PR #110 as `1864867`. The user
explicitly started parent AUTH-04. Required plan review split it before runtime
implementation. AUTH-04A merged through PR #111 as `90c9a28`, and its
post-merge memory merged through PR #112 as `7749f54`. The user explicitly
started AUTH-04B. Its repaired contract passed at `b5dceb1`; bounded
implementation and all required internal review tracks passed, and PR #113
merged as `05a63c8` after Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human
approval passed. AUTH-04B post-merge memory then merged through PR #114 as
`97cd0f5`, and the user explicitly started AUTH-05. Required plan review
rejected the combined contract before runtime edits and required 05A/05B.
The first 05A implementation review proved the original numeric ceiling
incompatible with readable typed/database privacy parity. Repaired 05A contract
review passed at `7cc6058`; the user subsequently replaced the line cap with
the semantic AUTH-05A boundary. Required reviews and checks passed, and explicit
human approval merged PR #115 as `8e1cde6` on 2026-07-14, followed by merged
post-merge memory. `WS-AUTH-001-CAT` then merged through PR #117 as `4c5d4fc`
after Backend, Agent Gates, CodeRabbit, and explicit human approval passed. The
CAT post-merge memory merged through PR #118 as `eba7e2b`; AUTH-05B then merged
through PR #119 as `ad71c7e`. AUTH-06 merged through PR #124 as `f599551`, its
signed automated memory completed, and the user explicitly started AUTH-07.
Required L1 review rejected the combined contract before runtime edits and
required 07A/07B. AUTH-07B was separately started and is internally approved;
do not start AUTH-08 or POL-002-04 without a separate explicit user start after
their prerequisites complete.

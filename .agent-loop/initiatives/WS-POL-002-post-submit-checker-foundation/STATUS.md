# Status: WS-POL-002 - Post-Submit Checker Foundation

## Current Status

Planning completed and merged through PR #85 as
`3fc1a688743f13476d6092078d40792592823d27`.

Chunk 03 merged through PR #90 as `a7aa474` on 2026-07-11. This authorization
worktree only reconciles that merged behavior with the active authorization
baseline. No later chunk may start until post-merge memory is updated, the
relevant authorization foundation exists, and the user provides a separate
explicit start signal.
`WS-POL-002-01` merged through PR #87 as `ed52c21` on 2026-07-09. It
implemented the version-stamped trusted post-submit compiler contract,
default-checker snapshot validation, canonical policy hashing, and tests around
default-drift safety.

`WS-POL-002-02` merged through PR #88 as `32af6a7` on 2026-07-11. It
implemented setup-time post-submit checker derivation, resumable setup
continuation, generated project `PostSubmitCheckerPolicy` persistence, automatic
contributor submission handoff to the pre-review gate, and repair-only
`/finalize` semantics.

## Active Planning Chunk

## Blockers

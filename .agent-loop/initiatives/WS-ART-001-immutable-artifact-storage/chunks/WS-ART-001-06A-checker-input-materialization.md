# Chunk Contract: WS-ART-001-06A Checker Input And Materialization

Initiative: `WS-ART-001` | Risk: L1 | Status: Proposed after 05

Artifact contract phase: `submission_cutover`

## Goal

Persist post-submit checker input snapshots and reuse the canonical authorized
artifact materializer introduced in 04B to place immutable submission bytes in
bounded isolated checker workspaces.

## Allowed Files

- checker input snapshot/run models, migration, repository, service, and worker;
- artifact binding/read service for checker input roles;
- the existing canonical artifact scratch manager and authorized materializer;
  extension is allowed only for post-submit snapshot integration, never a
  second workspace manager, ledger, quota, or cleanup path;
- checker/artifact call sites consuming exact decisions and service principals
  already delivered by approved WS-AUTH dependencies; no Authorization Service
  owner files;
- focused migration, retry, isolation, integrity, and real-flow tests;
- `.github/workflows/backend.yml` only to expand the exact 90 percent scoped gate;
- `scripts/test_agent_gates.py` only to assert that backend CI retains this
  chunk's exact scoped coverage sources and fail-closed 90 percent threshold;
- related docs and chunk memory.

## Not Allowed

- checker log/output artifact ingestion;
- post-submit review routing or WS-REV implementation;
- reviewer queue, lease, decision, or evidence behavior;
- checker direct access to provider credentials or provider references;
- mutable contributor paths as authoritative input;
- storage failure translated into product decisions or contributor blame.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `CheckerInputSnapshot` commits to submission version, artifact set, exact
  binding/content IDs, hashes/sizes, locked policy/checker versions, and checker
  implementation identity;
- pre-submit and post-submit input prove the same artifact-set hash;
- the post-submit runner receives only authorized immutable Workstream binding
  IDs and reuses the canonical materializer that pre-submit invoked with a
  sealed-ready upload-set source; both are closed forms of the same typed
  materialization request;
- the fixed checker service principal declares
  `artifact.post_submit.checker_input.materialize`, mapped to
  `artifact.checker_input.materialize`; it does not authorize any binding-create
  action;
- each hash and byte count is recomputed during materialization before checker
  execution;
- workspace allocation uses the shared aggregate ledger/quota, private
  no-follow paths, and startup/Celery Beat cleanup ownership; quota exhaustion
  fails closed before execution;
- files are sealed read-only after digest/size verification and before checker
  access; success, failure, cancellation, and crash/stale paths cannot orphan
  confidential bytes;
- transient unavailability leaves the post-submit task in
  `evaluation_pending`; missing/integrity mismatch blocks execution as an
  artifact incident and never becomes a review decision;
- no bytes enter PostgreSQL, Redis, or Celery payloads;
- changed subsystem coverage is at least 90 percent and repository coverage
  remains at least 78 percent;
- backend CI installs this chunk's exact focused 90 percent gate, preserves
  every earlier scoped 90 percent gate, and retains the exact 78 percent
  repository command below; `scripts/test_agent_gates.py` fails on workflow
  command, source-set, threshold, or cumulative-retention drift.

## Required Reviewers

Senior engineering, architecture, QA/test, security/auth, product/ops,
reuse/dedup, CI integrity, test delta, and docs.

## Human Review Focus

- Do both checker phases prove the same immutable bytes?
- Can a checker reach provider credentials or arbitrary storage references?
- Is materialization bounded, isolated, and integrity checked?
- Can any post-submit path bypass the exact materializer already used by
  pre-submit or leave a writable/orphaned workspace?

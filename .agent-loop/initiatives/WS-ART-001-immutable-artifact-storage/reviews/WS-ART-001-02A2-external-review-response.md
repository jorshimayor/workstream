# External Review Response: WS-ART-001-02A2

## Pull Request

PR #129: `https://github.com/Flow-Research/workstream/pull/129`

Reviewed code SHA: `ae70bc2f10334f649c1af7f210e58ee378695a2b`

Published evidence-bound head: pending after trusted `main` integration

## External Checks

- Agent Gates: passed before the trusted `main` integration; integrated-head
  rerun is pending publication.
- Backend: passed before the trusted `main` integration; integrated-head rerun
  is pending publication.
- CodeRabbit: all five prior actionable findings are marked addressed;
  integrated-head review is pending publication.

## Comments Addressed

- CodeRabbit: reject `NaN` and infinity in artifact preparation durations.
  Fixed with finite-number validation and regression cases.
- CodeRabbit: do not validate an in-progress root marker before acquiring the
  ledger lock. Fixed by validating marker contents under the lock.
- CodeRabbit: bound multiprocessing pipe receives and guarantee child cleanup.
  Fixed with timed `poll`, explicit failure, and `finally` cleanup.
- CodeRabbit: preserve the original cancellation when temporary cleanup fails
  and retain retryable `.part` ownership. Fixed in `aba8325` with exact
  cancellation-message proof, retained-file proof, canonical cleanup retry,
  and successful exact-request retry.
- CodeRabbit: make marker-validation ordering independent of spawned-process
  startup speed. Fixed in `aba8325` with explicit child-start and lock/order
  events plus bounded cold-start and child-shutdown limits.

## Comments Deferred

- None.

## Human Decisions Needed

The user remains the only merge authority for PR #129. Passing external checks
will not authorize merge or start `02A3`.

## Commands Rerun

Local deterministic and internal integration evidence is recorded in
`WS-ART-001-02A2-internal-review-evidence.md`. GitHub Agent Gates, Backend, and
CodeRabbit must now inspect the integrated evidence-bound head.

## Remaining Risks

- The preparation boundary is intentionally inactive until `02A3`.
- No prior external finding remains open. Final integrated-head status is
  pending GitHub publication.

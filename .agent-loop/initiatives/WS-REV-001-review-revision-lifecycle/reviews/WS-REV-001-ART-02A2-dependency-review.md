# Dependency Review: Merged ART-02A2

## Scope

Read-only review of ART-02A2 from prior trusted main
`aa0fdcd6912e66609e39a2fbd7b65f67be6c62f3` through merged trusted main
`9a04434e2f23c5dec8939dadb943bba4d85110c0` and its impact on the WS-REV plan.
ART implementation remains owned by WS-ART.

ART's internal evidence records 154 focused tests at 94.40 percent scoped
coverage, 38 isolated artifact PostgreSQL tests, 207 isolated
AUTH/authentication/Alembic tests, 71 agent-gate tests, and 94.8 percent
repository docstring coverage.

## Confirmed Boundary

- ART-02A2 adds inactive provider-neutral `PreparedArtifact` and
  `CommittedArtifactSource` types whose server commitment remains inseparable
  from the exact second-pass bytes.
- `ArtifactScratchManager` owns bounded private ephemeral processing scratch
  with aggregate quota, file/concurrency limits, free-space admission,
  deadlines, crash cleanup, no-follow/private-file checks, and a cross-process
  ledger. The ledger is not PostgreSQL, Redis, artifact storage, or durable
  product state.
- The shared bounded file-lock/cancellation primitives and LocalStorage private
  helpers preserve custody through timeout, cancellation, close, cleanup, and
  retry.
- Active ArtifactStore v1, provider selection, schema, product routes, and
  artifact lifecycle behavior remain unchanged.
- The chunk adds no actor, action, permission, resource context, grant, or
  service-principal authority.
- No S3 SDK, MinIO, AWS S3, R2, Flow Node, admission, verification/publication,
  reviewer packet read, evidence intake, checker cutover, recovery activation,
  or live proof is included.

## REV Disposition

ART-02A2 is compatible with REV as an ART-owned future intake foundation only.
REV never imports `ArtifactScratchManager`, `PreparedArtifact`, or
`CommittedArtifactSource`; persists scratch paths, ledger reservations, source
descriptors, or anonymous read handles; or constructs another preparation or
cleanup path. Review services consume only later typed ART capabilities through
composition-root registration.

This merge resolves the final planning-publication dependency, not the runtime
ART gates. ART-02A3, 02B1, 02C1-02C3, 02D, 03, 04A/04B, 05, 06A/06B, and 07
remain dependency-owned gates where their v2, S3, admission,
verification/publication, operator recovery, guide/upload/submission/checker,
reviewer read/intake/retention/projection, and live-proof contracts are needed.

## Snapshot Evidence

Current non-review initiative snapshot digest:
`a9b37925682a06e7d7871b7b060bf53efd23f8f67535ecb417f5259a1b5f7055`.

The digest hashes sorted `sha256sum` output for initiative files excluding
`reviews/**`; it binds this merged-ART dependency refresh before the reviewed
code commit and final evidence-only publication binding.

## Current Refresh Reviewer Status

Required exact-snapshot REV reviewer fanout is pending. Final reviewer results
and run IDs will be recorded here before the reviewed code commit is bound in
`WS-REV-001-PLAN-internal-review-evidence.md`.

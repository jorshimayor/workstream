# Chunk Map: WS-REV-001 Review And Revision Lifecycle

## Rule

One executable chunk maps to one PR. Merged parent IDs remain non-executable
split records. A proposed child is not executable until its own current-main
contract is authored, internally reviewed, explicitly started, and every owner
gate is proven by exact chunk ID, merged PR/SHA, migration head where relevant,
typed symbol/manifest, and tests.

## Same-initiative order

```text
PLAN -> 01 -> 02(parent) -> PLAN2 -> 02A -> 02B -> 02C

```

Non-executable parents do not consume a PR after this planning refresh. Their
first child is the successor of the preceding executable chunk.

## Owner-gate rule

Phrases such as "AUTH contributor foundation", "ART owner amendment", or
"CON participant" describe required ownership but are not executable gates.
Before a child starts, replace each phrase in its new contract with:

```text
owner chunk ID + merged PR + merge SHA + migration head (if schema)
+ typed symbol/manifest + exact focused and regression test evidence
```

Known merged/planned CON IDs may be named, but proposed status remains blocked.
The contributor clean cut and ART packet-read/review-evidence/digest work do not
yet have trusted-main owner chunk IDs. REV neither invents those IDs nor edits
owner plans.

## Parent split records

Existing parent contract files for 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 09A, 11, 12, former
12A release control, and 13 are non-executable historical planning records.
They must not be used as implementation authorization. New child contracts are
authored only from the then-current main when each child receives a human start.

## Reviewers

Every executable chunk requires senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, and
product/ops. Architecture and reuse/dedup apply throughout. Schema/routes/jobs/
active behavior add docs and test-delta. Workflows, scripts, dependencies, test
configuration, or coverage changes add CI integrity.

## Stop condition

Complete and merge only `WS-REV-001-PLAN2`, then stop. Its schema-v2 merge
intent names `WS-REV-001-02A` and requires a separate explicit start after the
exact AUTH runtime foundation merges. Do not begin 02A or any later child from
this planning PR.

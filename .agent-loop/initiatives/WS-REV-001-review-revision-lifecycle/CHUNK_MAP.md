# Chunk Map: WS-REV-001 Review And Revision Lifecycle

## Rule

One chunk maps to one PR. No runtime chunk starts until its AUTH, ART, and CON
gates are satisfied on current trusted `main` and the user gives a separate
explicit start signal.

## Chunks

| Chunk | Title | Risk | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `WS-REV-001-PLAN` | Review And Revision Lifecycle Planning | L1 | None | Active; post-AUTH-09A current-main reconciliation in review |

## Dependency order

```text
PLAN -> 01 -> 02 -> 03 -> 04 -> 05 -> 06 -> 07 -> 08 -> 09A -> 09B -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 12A -> 13
```

External initiative gates are inserted without changing same-initiative
successor order:

```text
WS-REV-001-01 active contract and immutable registration/service manifests
  -> WS-AUTH-001-REV-REG availability-neutral four-action registration
  -> separately reviewed AUTH identity-specific extension contracts
  -> corresponding REV mutation/service chunks may consume registered actions
     and exact identities while every action remains unavailable

AUTH canonical human plus an AUTH-owned schema-only contributor-field foundation
  + merged AUTH-08 transaction/error/timestamp invariants
  + ART v2 stable contracts
  -> WS-REV-001-02

WS-REV-001-02
  -> WS-CON exact attribution consumption and retired compensation-context field removal

WS-REV-001-02 + merged WS-CON ContributionPolicyVersion persistence
  -> WS-REV-001-03

WS-REV-001-03 + merged CON-owned shared transactional-outbox persistence
  -> WS-REV-001-04

merged CON-owned caller-transaction shared lifecycle-audit participant
  -> WS-REV-001-04

WS-REV-001-04 stable Review, FinalAcceptance, ReviewLease, and Submission schemas
  + merged ART submission/checker cutover with server-derived stabilized
    Submission.artifact_hash
  -> WS-CON exact FinalAcceptance-sourced contribution/award lineage persistence

WS-CON retired compensation-context field removal
  -> WS-REV-001-09A

WS-REV-001-09A hidden prepared revision/replacement behavior
  -> amended AUTH-13/14 full product cutovers
  -> AUTH-14 submission.create activation after exact evaluator proof

WS-REV-001-09B + WS-CON exact lineage schema + flush-only contribution/award participant
  -> WS-REV-001-10

WS-CON exact core hidden-readiness manifest + WS-REV-001-12
  -> WS-REV-001-12A hidden joint release-control foundation
  -> AUTH activates each exact action through its named REV gate after hidden behavior
  -> WS-REV-001-13 sole joint product release
```

The merged ART plan does not yet schedule `WS-ART-001-REV-EVIDENCE`. REV-07 is
therefore explicitly blocked until ART owns, approves, and merges that chunk;
REV planning does not create or start it on ART's behalf.

## Chunk boundaries

- 01 changes contracts and active documentation, not runtime behavior.
- 02-04 land persistence and constraints, including immutable FinalAcceptance,
  without public review mutations.
- 05-07 build routing, leases, and evidence consumption behind an unavailable
  production composition boundary; registration remains availability-neutral.
- 08 freezes decision inputs, validation, task effects, and the
  FinalAcceptance consequence of `accept`. It cannot commit a canonical Review
  or an accept-path FinalAcceptance until the CON participant is installed.
- 09A prepares controlled revision context and immutable resubmission input.
- 09B completes finding replay, resolution, and preferred-return semantics.
- 10 creates the first transaction capable of committing every canonical Review
  and, for `accept`, the additional FinalAcceptance record. It proves WS-CON
  atomicity in hidden composition.
- 11-12 complete operations, recovery, projection, and observability.
- 12A lands hidden persisted release control and mandatory cross-domain fences.
- 13 performs fail-closed preflight, exposes the already-AUTH-active coherent
  public API set,
  proves the whole lifecycle, and closes generated/user/operator docs.

## Required reviewer tracks

Every chunk: senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, and product/ops.

Add architecture and reuse/dedup to 01-13. Add docs to PLAN and every chunk that
changes schema, routes, runtime jobs, configuration, or active behavior: 01-13. Add
test-delta to every runtime chunk. Add CI integrity whenever a
workflow, script, dependency, or coverage gate changes.

## Stop condition

Planning is approved and merged AUTH PR #140/AUTH-08/AUTH-09A/ART-02A2 contracts are reconciled.
Publication still requires final exact-snapshot review and evidence binding. Do
not start 01 automatically; its merge-intent gate remains separate.

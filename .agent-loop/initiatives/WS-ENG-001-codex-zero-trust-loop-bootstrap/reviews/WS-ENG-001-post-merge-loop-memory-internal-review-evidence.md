After reviewed SHA `f4fe5f3c4fbdd626bbc6d3f837aeca1cceb6e9ca`, the only committed path changed in this PR is this internal review evidence file. No implementation, workflow, test, policy, or loop-memory state file changed after that reviewed SHA.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None remaining | Confirmed merged-loop memory is no longer stale, the guard is post-merge scoped, and `workflow_dispatch` is low risk because it does not run on PR events. |
| qa/test | PASS | None | Confirmed loop-memory tests use fixtures instead of live checkout state, so valid PR pre-merge memory is not blocked. |
| security/auth | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None remaining | Confirmed this change touches engineering-loop state and CI only; no Workstream auth, session, token, product runtime, or permission behavior changed. |
| product/ops | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None remaining | Confirmed post-merge state now says no active chunk, no active PR gate, and future work must start from an approved intent/plan/chunk contract. Low-risk stale wording in `WORK_QUEUE.md` was fixed. |
| architecture | PASS | None | Confirmed the change stays in the Codex engineering loop and does not turn loop state into Workstream product functionality. |
| docs | PASS | None | Confirmed status wording distinguishes merged state, inactive queue state, and external review response logging. |
| ci integrity | PASS AFTER FIXES | None remaining | Confirmed the new main-only loop-memory workflow uses pinned checkout, disabled credential persistence, and a deterministic Python guard. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS | None | Confirmed the guard reuses existing loop files and does not introduce another competing source of truth. |
| test delta | PASS AFTER FIXES | None remaining | Confirmed `scripts/test_agent_gates.py` covers stale pre-merge memory rejection and merged-state acceptance with temporary fixtures. |

## Valid Findings Addressed

- Local Workstream directory confusion: identified `<repo-root>` as a separate dirty feature branch, not `main`, and left unrelated checker/test changes untouched.
- Stale merged-loop memory: updated `.agent-loop/LOOP_STATE.md`, initiative `STATUS.md`, `WORK_QUEUE.md`, and `REVIEW_LOG.md` to reflect that PR #23 is merged.
- Missing main enforcement: added the verified workflow path `.github/workflows/loop-memory.yml` so merged loop memory is checked on pushes to `main`.
- Over-broad local-state test risk: changed loop-memory regression tests to use fixture files instead of the live repository state.
- Missing internal evidence for this process change: added this separate internal-review evidence file for PR #24.
- Stale post-merge wording: changed `After this bootstrap lands` to `After this bootstrap has landed` in `.agent-loop/WORK_QUEUE.md`.

## Commands Run

```bash
python3 scripts/check_loop_memory_state.py
python3 scripts/test_agent_gates.py
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_workstream_wording.py
python3 -m py_compile scripts/check_loop_memory_state.py scripts/test_agent_gates.py
git diff --check HEAD~1..HEAD
```

## Remaining Risks

- `<repo-root>` remains dirty on `codex/submission-artifact-policy-docs` with unrelated checker/revision testing changes. Those changes were not modified here because they are outside PR #24.

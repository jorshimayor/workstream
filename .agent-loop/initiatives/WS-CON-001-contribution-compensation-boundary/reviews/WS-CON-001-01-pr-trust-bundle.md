# PR Trust Bundle: WS-CON-001-01

## Chunk

`WS-CON-001-01` - Canonical Contract Adoption And Architecture Decision

Risk: L0 direction executed as L1 specification work; SLA P1.

## Goal

Publish one repository-owned contribution/compensation specification and ADR
0016, reconciled with merged AUTH, REV, ART, and WS-XINT boundaries, without
changing runtime or archival inputs.

## Human-Approved Intent

The human approved the reconciled WS-CON plan, accept-only
`Review -> FinalAcceptance -> accepted_submission`, ContributionPolicy
superseding the retired economic model, no v0.1 adjudication, and explicit start
of this chunk.

## What Changed

- Added the canonical contribution/compensation specification and ADR 0016.
- Linked both from README with explicit precedence.
- Corrected active data-model naming and mirrored numeric/receipt rules.
- Recorded active-doc inventory, conformance proof, decisions, status, review
  evidence, and one merge intent.

## Why It Changed

The archival input and old runtime-oriented chunk documents did not reflect
merged FinalAcceptance, AUTH custody/prepared mutation, optional ART evidence,
dispatcher/handler separation, or the joint release fence. One active contract
is required before schema/runtime chunks proceed.

## Design Chosen

- ContributionPolicy is the only target eligibility policy.
- TaskAssignment and ReviewLease independently freeze immutable versions.
- Every valid Review creates reviewer recognition; accept alone creates
  FinalAcceptance and submitter recognition.
- One mandatory CON participant has separate reviewer and accept-only submitter
  operations; REV stages audit/outbox and the caller commits once.
- Awards are immutable policy results; adapters only fulfill them after commit.
- AUTH owns identifier, evaluator, evidence, service admission, and activation;
  22 mappings remain non-final proposals.
- One shared outbox and one REV-owned controller/fence govern delivery.
- Quantities use `NUMERIC(38, 18)` and receipts store only bounded, minimized
  canonical facts.

## Alternatives Rejected

- Direct submitter inference from Review.decision.
- Manual or independently authorized FinalAcceptance.
- One nullable cross-actor participant input.
- CON-owned commit or post-commit contribution repair.
- A compatibility alias or fallback economic policy.
- Mandatory ART evidence in the core transaction.
- Provider-decided award eligibility.
- Dispatcher authority inherited by handlers.
- A second CON release controller.
- Adjudication in v0.1.

## Scope Control

Changed files are limited to canonical docs, README precedence, the active
data-model correction, WS-CON initiative artifacts, and exactly one merge
intent. No backend, migration, AUTH/ART/REV-owned runtime contract, workflow,
dependency, test, coverage, or roadmap/export file changed.

The user-owned deleted reference PDF was not staged or committed.

## Product Behavior

Runtime behavior is unchanged. The documents define target behavior and keep
all routes hidden until implementation, AUTH activation, and joint release.

## Acceptance Criteria Proof

- ADR 0016 follows independent ADR 0015.
- Required policy, binding, contribution, award, receipt, status, outbox, audit,
  authorization, adapter, and release contracts are defined.
- Legacy cleanup is split across 05A/05B with no fallback or implicit unpaid.
- FinalAcceptance lineage, two operations, single commit, zero core ART calls,
  and no adjudication match merged REV.
- All 22 action mappings are unregistered and non-final.
- D11, legacy rows, service authority, and optional evidence remain human gates.
- `/api/v1`, secret exclusion, conformance mapping, and archive preservation are
  explicit.

## Tests And Checks Run

```text
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_workstream_wording.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_authorization_docs.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_artifact_contracts.py
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python3 -m pytest -q scripts/test_agent_gates.py
git diff --check
```

All passed; agent gates reported 80 tests passed. Both present archival hashes
matched, the committed reference-spec diff was empty, and the mapping count was
exactly 22.

## Test Delta

No tests, scanners, test configuration, or coverage thresholds changed. The
existing tests were run unchanged.

## CI Integrity

No workflow, package script, dependency, lint/typecheck command, test runner, or
coverage threshold changed. CI-integrity review passed.

## Reviewer Results

Exact reviewed SHA: `0b663f38b4a8fc7058e4e71932d72571d2cc2b6a`.

| Track | Result |
|---|---|
| Senior engineering | PASS |
| QA/test | PASS |
| Security/auth | PASS after receipt/numeric repairs |
| Product/ops | PASS |
| Architecture | PASS |
| Docs | PASS after conformance/inventory repairs |
| Reuse/dedup | PASS |
| CI integrity | PASS |

All valid findings were repaired and all tracks passed at the exact SHA with no
remaining findings. No sub-agent session remains open.

## External Review

Pending GitHub CI, CodeRabbit, and human PR review. They supplement but do not
replace the completed internal tracks.

## Remaining Risks

- D11 administrative role candidates are still human/AUTH gates.
- Legacy row classification is still a human migration gate.
- Protected service identities/actions/static rows are not yet approved.
- AUTH, REV, task, ART-lineage, outbox, and release runtime prerequisites remain
  unimplemented and must refresh from trusted main per chunk.

## Follow-Up Work

The same-initiative successor is `WS-CON-001-02A`, shared transactional outbox
persistence. It requires a separate explicit start after this PR merges. This
chunk does not start it.

## Human Review Focus

1. Confirm FinalAcceptance and the two-operation transaction boundary.
2. Confirm ContributionPolicy fully supersedes the retired economic model.
3. Confirm AUTH owns activation and proposed identifiers stay non-final.
4. Confirm numeric/unit and provider-receipt minimization decisions.
5. Confirm open D11, legacy-row, and protected-service gates are acceptable.

## Human Merge Ownership

Only the human owner may approve and merge the specific PR. Passing reviewers,
CI, or CodeRabbit do not authorize merge or the next chunk.

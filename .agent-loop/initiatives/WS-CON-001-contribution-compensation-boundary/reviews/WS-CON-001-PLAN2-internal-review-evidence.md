This provenance-only addendum binds the reviewed FinalAcceptance reconciliation
to the final cumulative planning snapshot. It changes no PLAN2 lifecycle fact.
The exact-SHA re-review confirms that PLAN3 preserves REV-owned
FinalAcceptance, CON flush-only participation, all three review outcomes, and
the no-adjudication boundary while adopting merged REV's exact two-operation
ordering and joint release-control contract.

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | FinalAcceptance and contribution responsibilities retain single owners and one commit after contract metadata repair. |
| qa/test | PASS | None | Accept, needs-revision, reject, lineage, rollback, and evidence completeness pass. |
| security/auth | PASS | None | No FinalAcceptance action/API, adjudication path, authorization bypass, or CON evaluator is introduced. |
| product/ops | PASS | None | Reviewer and submitter contribution triggers remain Review and FinalAcceptance respectively. |
| architecture | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | REV persistence, two CON operations, REV composition, joint release control, and later AUTH activation remain correctly ordered. |
| ci integrity | PASS | None | The rebind changes evidence only and weakens no gate. |
| docs | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Historical PLAN2 conclusions, merged REV refinements, and final provenance are explicit. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS | None | Existing REV/AUTH contracts are referenced without a parallel path. |
| test delta | PASS | None | No test delta; all 80 agent-gate tests pass. |

## Reviewed boundary

The reviewed specification snapshot establishes:

- `Review(accept) -> FinalAcceptance -> accepted_submission`;
- one reviewer `completed_review` for every valid human Review;
- REV-owned Review/FinalAcceptance/task/assignment/audit/outbox orchestration
  and one commit;
- CON-owned flush-only contribution/award participation with no ART or provider
  call;
- canonical `Submission.id` version identity and exact immutable
  `ReviewPolicy.id` lineage;
- exact `accepted`, `needs_revision`, and `rejected` effects; and
- no v0.1 adjudication action, policy, queue, lease, state, decision,
  contribution, branch, readiness dependency, manual FinalAcceptance API, or
  independent FinalAcceptance authorization action.

The pre-existing deletion of the archival WS-CON PDF was excluded from this
chunk and remains user-owned.

## Internal reviews

### Architecture

Final result: PASS.

Resolved findings:

- removed the REV/CON cycle by ordering REV persistence and locked lineage,
  then CON-03C/07, then REV hidden composition, then AUTH activation;
- resolved `policy_context_ref` to canonical immutable `ReviewPolicy.id`;
- reverted an out-of-scope global AUTH role-catalogue wording change;
- bounded active reviewer-quality wording changes explicitly in PLAN2; and
- consolidated duplicate second-review/template language into non-mutating
  post-decision quality-audit sampling.

### QA, product/ops, docs, and test delta

Final result: PASS.

Resolved findings:

- made non-accept effects exact: needs revision keeps the Assignment active;
  reject uses canonical Task `rejected`, blocks only the same-task Assignment
  with its source Review, and changes no grant or unrelated task;
- rejected the archival `closed/review_rejected` token using current REV plan,
  discovery, and conformance evidence;
- classified historical `docs/review_*` recommendations as non-normative; and
- removed active mutating “overturned”/second-review wording in favor of
  non-mutating reviewer-quality audit observations.

### Security and authorization

Final result: PASS.

The reviewer confirmed no FinalAcceptance ActionId/API, adjudication path,
catalogue/runtime/backend change, grant mutation, cross-task reject effect, or
authorization bypass. CON remains flush-only and REV remains the sole commit
owner.

## Deterministic evidence

Passed on the final reviewed snapshot:

```text
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_workstream_wording.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_authorization_docs.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_artifact_contracts.py
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python3 -m pytest -q scripts/test_agent_gates.py
git diff --check
test -z "$(git diff --name-only -- backend)"
```

Result: 80 agent-gate tests passed; markdown links and all stale-contract scans
passed; no backend delta exists.

## Stop

PLAN2 is complete but unpublished. No runtime chunk, push, or PR begins without
explicit human direction.

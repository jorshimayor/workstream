# WS-CON-001-02A Preimplementation Plan Review

## REV PLAN2 Current-Main Reconciliation

Trusted main advanced to `983b9e534b84f1590fafecc0ce1355cf131257ce`
through planning-only REV PLAN2 PR #150. The merge changes no backend runtime,
migration, test runner, AUTH catalogue, outbox contract, or 02A allowed-file
scope. It preserves the two ordered CON operations, accept-only
FinalAcceptance, REV-owned shared audit/outbox staging, and one caller commit.
It replaces future non-executable REV parent gates with explicit children:
CON-03B precedes REV-03A, CON-02A/02C precede REV-04B, CON-03C/07 precede
REV-10, the shared dispatcher/handler registry precedes REV-12P1, CON fence
hooks precede REV-12A3, and CON-11 precedes REV-13C. No 02A implementation
change is required.

An exact isolated suite started on the prior `99ae4c96` baseline was stopped
after two hours solely because PR #150 advanced trusted main. It produced no
accepted evidence artifact and is not counted below. Exact verification must
restart on the frozen `983b9e53` baseline.

## AUTH-09D-A Current-Main Reconciliation

Trusted main advanced to `99ae4c963e53f317175dcb308b9e47c93ccf19ed`
through AUTH-09D-A PR #148 before publication. AUTH now owns
`0026_actor_profile_lifecycle`, so CON-02A's reviewed linear migration is
`0027_shared_transactional_outbox` with parent
`0026_actor_profile_lifecycle`. AUTH-09D-A activates only three actor-profile
lifecycle actions; it adds no CON/outbox identifier, evaluator, service
identity, static row, fixed-service admission, or product behavior.
The exact full-suite safety ceiling is 25,200 seconds because the prior
pre-AUTH-09D-A suite consumed 17,741.96 of 18,000 seconds and PR #148 added
substantial backend/migration tests. This changes no selection, assertion,
isolation control, or 78/90 coverage threshold.

## Exact baseline and scope

- Baseline: trusted `origin/main` at `a10d901` after ART PR #141 merged.
- Risk: L1 infrastructure, schema, concurrency, audit, and data-integrity risk.
- Delivery priority: P1 active-sprint prerequisite for REV/CON composition.
- Human checkpoint: required before merge.
- Allowed implementation files and exclusions are exactly those in
  `../chunks/WS-CON-001-02A-shared-outbox-persistence.md`.
- The user-owned deleted reference PDF is outside scope and must remain
  unstaged and untouched.
- Before final implementation evidence, trusted `main` advanced again to
  `0ffdabf` through AUTH-09C PR #146. Its administrative actor/profile reads
  activate only existing AUTH-owned identifiers, add no migration or CON
  action, and leave this reviewed implementation contract unchanged.
- Trusted `main` later advanced to `b2b9016` through REV-01 PR #145. Its
  canonical review specification preserves the exact FinalAcceptance,
  two-operation CON participant, shared-outbox, and single-commit boundaries;
  it adds no backend runtime or migration and does not alter this plan.
- Trusted `main` later advanced to `f18b620` through planning-only REV-02 PR
  #147. Its future REV chunk decomposition adds no runtime, migration, test
  runner, CON, or outbox behavior and leaves this plan unchanged.
- The canonical isolated full-suite command later reached 90 percent with no
  failures but hit its 12,600-second process ceiling. The ceiling is raised to
  18,000 seconds for the unchanged complete test set and unchanged 78/90
  percent coverage gates; no test, assertion, or CI policy is skipped or
  weakened.

## Proposed implementation

1. Add one `OutboxEvent` PostgreSQL table and SQLAlchemy model containing the
   exact immutable common event envelope and canonical payload digest frozen
   below, plus the complete generic operational-delivery shape required by the
   later migration-free CON-02B dispatcher chunk.
2. Enforce event/idempotency uniqueness, the exact payload/digest/token bounds
   below, database-owned occurrence time, closed delivery-state shapes,
   immutable envelope/payload custody, permanent physical delete/truncate
   denial, terminal archival-in-place, and a nonempty-table downgrade guard in
   linear revision `0027_shared_transactional_outbox` after AUTH-owned
   `0026_actor_profile_lifecycle`.
3. Add strict typed append input/output schemas. The caller supplies stable
   event identity and canonical event facts but not occurrence or delivery
   state. The service hashes only the validated payload with
   `canonical_json_hash`.
4. Reuse the existing PostgreSQL reserve/lock/replay sequence and typed
   conflict/replay semantics, without importing AUTH or creating a generic
   idempotency abstraction. Attempt the completed event insert with
   `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; insertion itself is the event reservation and
   there is no separate pending-to-complete idempotency record. Lock matches in
   ascending event-ID order and apply the collision matrix below. Flush/refresh
   only; transaction commit remains caller-owned. Never commit, publish,
   enqueue, log payloads, or open another session.
5. Register the model in shared metadata and add PostgreSQL tests for linear
   migration upgrade/guarded downgrade, schema/trigger invariants, append and
   exact replay, the full collision/race matrix, canonical key-order replay,
   payload/error privacy bounds, and caller rollback proving no independent
   commit or publication.
6. Run the exact isolated CON-02A evidence row, focused coverage at or above 90
   percent, repository coverage at or above 78 percent, Ruff, stale-wording and
   link checks, then fan out all required internal reviewer tracks on one exact
   commit SHA. Repair and rerun evidence/review before opening the full PR.

## Explicit non-goals

- No AUTH catalogue or evaluator changes and no outbox action/permission.
- No dispatcher, Celery task, broker, registry, handler, route, claim action,
  retry execution, feature delivery, or external I/O.
- No contribution, compensation, review, task, project, audit, or ART behavior.
- No second JSON canonicalizer, generic idempotency framework, dependency, or
  CI/coverage change.
- No CON-02B work.

## Frozen persistence schema

### Immutable columns

| Column | PostgreSQL type | Null/default/bounds |
|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | `UUID` | primary key; caller-supplied |
| `event_type` | `VARCHAR(128)` | non-null; ASCII token `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._:-]{0,127}` |
| `event_version` | `SMALLINT` | non-null; `1..32767` |
| `producer` | `VARCHAR(32)` | non-null; database-forced `workstream` |
| `aggregate_type` | `VARCHAR(64)` | non-null; lower ASCII token `[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}` |
| `aggregate_id` | `UUID` | non-null; canonical source aggregate identity |
| `project_id` | `VARCHAR(36)` | non-null FK to `projects.id`; canonical lowercase UUID text |
| `correlation_id` | `VARCHAR(200)` | non-null; ASCII token `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,200}` |
| `causation_event_id` | `UUID` | nullable; no FK because the cause may live in another event ledger |
| `idempotency_key` | `VARCHAR(200)` | non-null; globally unique; ASCII token `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,200}` |
| `payload` | `JSONB` | non-null object; generic structural/privacy bounds below |
| `payload_digest` | `VARCHAR(71)` | non-null `sha256:` plus 64 lowercase hex characters |
| `occurred_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | non-null; database-forced `statement_timestamp()` |

The event ID and globally namespaced idempotency key are independent unique
identities. Every column in this table is immutable except the operational
allowlist below. The database insert trigger overwrites producer, occurrence
time, initial state, counters, eligibility time, and all nullable operational
fields so direct SQL cannot forge an already-claimed or completed event.

### Mutable operational columns

| Column | PostgreSQL type | Initial/bounds |
|---|---|---|
| `delivery_state` | `VARCHAR(16)` | `pending`; closed set `pending`, `claimed`, `retryable`, `acknowledged`, `dead_letter`, `cancelled` |
| `attempt_count` | `INTEGER` | `0`; nonnegative and equal to claim generation |
| `next_attempt_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | occurrence time while initially pending; otherwise state-bound |
| `claim_owner` | `VARCHAR(120)` | nullable bounded ASCII token |
| `claim_generation` | `BIGINT` | `0`; nonnegative and incremented with each claim |
| `claimed_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | nullable; equals `last_attempt_at` while claimed |
| `claim_expires_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | nullable; greater than `claimed_at` |
| `last_attempt_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | nullable; database-time attempt evidence |
| `last_error_code` | `VARCHAR(80)` | nullable; `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{0,79}` only; never free-form diagnostics |
| `finalized_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | nullable; required for terminal states |
| `archived_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | nullable; allowed only for terminal rows and not before `finalized_at` |

There is no physical purge seam. Retention in v0.1 means terminal
archival-in-place by setting `archived_at`; immutable event/payload truth is
never deleted or truncated. CON-02B may mutate only this operational allowlist.

### Closed state shapes

| State | Required shape |
|---|---|
| `pending` | zero attempts/generation; eligibility present; no claim, attempt, error, final, or archive fields |
| `claimed` | positive equal attempts/generation; owner, claimed/last-attempt, and future lease expiry present; no eligibility/final/archive fields; prior bounded error may remain |
| `retryable` | positive equal attempts/generation; eligibility, last attempt, and bounded error present; no live claim/final/archive fields |
| `acknowledged` | positive equal attempts/generation; last attempt and final time present; no eligibility/live claim; bounded prior error and later archive marker are allowed |
| `dead_letter` | positive equal attempts/generation; last attempt, bounded error, and final time present; no eligibility/live claim; later archive marker allowed |
| `cancelled` | final time present and no eligibility/live claim; either never attempted with zero generation/no attempt evidence or positive equal attempts/generation with last-attempt evidence; later archive marker allowed |

All operational timestamps are at or after `occurred_at`; claim expiry is
strictly after claim time; finalization is not before the last attempt when one
exists; archival is not before finalization. Expired `claimed` work may recover
to `retryable`, and only an unarchived `dead_letter` terminal may be requeued,
in both cases by clearing live-claim/final fields and satisfying the retryable
shape. `acknowledged` and `cancelled` never reopen. CON-02B owns the transition
service and authorization, not this chunk.

### Required indexes

- `(event_type, delivery_state, next_attempt_at, occurred_at, event_id)` for
  deterministic eligible-work selection;
- `(aggregate_type, aggregate_id, occurred_at, event_id)` for source-aggregate
  reconciliation without inspecting payloads;
- `(claim_expires_at, event_id)` partial on `claimed` for expired-lease recovery;
- `(project_id, delivery_state, occurred_at, event_id)` for same-session drain
  counts and project-bounded observation;
- `(finalized_at, event_id)` partial on terminal rows with `archived_at IS NULL`
  for retention eligibility;
- the primary key and global unique idempotency-key constraint for replay.

## Payload and privacy contract

The generic outbox accepts only a JSON object after producer-owned typed payload
validation. Every object key must use lower ASCII snake case
`[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,127}`. It independently rejects floats, bytes, non-JSON values, more than
16 container levels, more than 4,096 total nodes, more than 1,024 members in
one object/list, keys over 128 UTF-8 bytes, strings over 16,384 UTF-8 bytes, and
integers outside signed 38-digit magnitude. A conservative traversal budget
must prove the canonical UTF-8 encoding cannot exceed 262,144 bytes without
serializing through a second canonicalizer; PostgreSQL also checks the stored
JSONB text representation is at most 262,144 bytes.

At every nesting level the generic validator first case-folds keys and converts
hyphens to underscores for denylist comparison, then independently enforces the
lower-snake-case key grammar. It rejects credential-bearing normalized keys:
`authorization`, `cookie`, `credentials`, `password`, `secret`,
`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`, `bearer_token`, `jwks`,
`signed_url`, `raw_callback`, `raw_provider_response`, `artifact_bytes`,
`request_body`, and `response_body`. Capitalization and hyphen/underscore
variants therefore cannot bypass the privacy check. Producer payload schemas must additionally
exclude bearer tokens, credentials, key material, raw claims, provider URLs or
messages, callback bodies, artifact bytes, and unbounded/free-form sensitive
diagnostics. Bounded non-secret opaque identifiers remain allowed where their
feature specification permits them.

Validation order is structure/privacy bounds, canonical hash, then database
reservation. Invalid input and idempotency conflict raise typed exceptions
whose messages contain only stable error codes; no exception, log, result, or
failure-code field contains payload values or secrets. The outbox module emits
no logs in this chunk.

## Replay and collision matrix

Replay compares event ID, event type, event version, fixed producer, aggregate
type/ID, project, correlation, causation, idempotency key, and canonical payload
digest. It also confirms stored JSONB object equality defensively. It preserves the original
database occurrence time and ignores all operational delivery fields.

| Locked match | Result |
|---|---|
| no identity exists | insert and return `created` |
| event ID and key resolve to the same row; every immutable fact matches | return that row as `replayed` |
| either identity exists with any immutable fact/digest drift | typed `outbox_idempotency_conflict` |
| event ID and key resolve to two different rows | typed `outbox_idempotency_conflict` |

Conflict lookup locks every distinct matching row in ascending `event_id`
order. Tests cover same/same, canonical object-key reordering, same ID/different
key, different ID/same key, changed payload, changed aggregate/envelope,
pre-seeded split identities, and independent-session races in both first-reserver
commit and rollback orders. If the first reserver commits, an exact contender
replays and a changed contender conflicts. If the first reserver rolls back,
the contender inserts as `created`; rolled-back truth never produces replay or
conflict. Exactly one row is durable in either order.

## Operational transition matrix

Database checks and the custody trigger permit only these future CON-02B
transitions; this chunk exposes no transition method:

- `pending -> claimed | cancelled`;
- `claimed -> retryable | acknowledged | dead_letter | cancelled`;
- `retryable -> claimed | cancelled`;
- unarchived `dead_letter -> retryable` for later independently authorized
  recovery;
- `pending -> pending` or `retryable -> retryable` only to change eligibility
  time for later independently authorized recovery/reconciliation;
- terminal same-state update only to set the one-way `archived_at` marker.

Every claim increments attempt count and claim generation together by exactly
one. Every outcome preserves both values. They never decrease. Requeue clears
finalization and preserves attempt/generation history. `acknowledged` and
`cancelled` never reopen; archived dead letters never reopen. No state may
transition out of archival, and no same-state mutation may change immutable or
unrelated operational facts.

## Migration and transaction proof details

- Upgrade from exact revision `0025_artifact_store_v2` and verify
  columns, constraints, indexes, triggers, metadata, and head identity.
- Attempt direct SQL mutation of every immutable column and physical delete/
  truncate; each must fail. Exercise every operational column through at least
  one complete legal state sequence so the allowlist is not over-constrained,
  and directly prove acknowledged/cancelled/archived reopening and illegal
  same-state mutation fail.
- A downgrade takes `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock before checking emptiness. Test it
  against an uncommitted insert in both commit and rollback orders: committed
  truth blocks downgrade; rolled-back truth permits it.
- After the nonempty refusal, remove only test data with triggers explicitly
  disabled, prove empty downgrade succeeds, then restore head.
- Inject failure after append insert/flush/refresh and roll back the caller
  session; prove zero outbox row, no commit, no broker/publish/enqueue call, and
  no other observable side effect.

## Proof and reviewer routing

Required tracks: senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, product/ops,
architecture, docs, reuse/dedup, test-delta, and CI integrity. Review must focus
on caller transaction ownership, PostgreSQL duplicate-race behavior, immutable
versus operational field separation, payload privacy/integrity, forward
compatibility with 02B without implementing it, migration downgrade safety,
and preservation of the exact chunk boundary.

## Review result

PASS after repair. Initial review found that the migration-free 02B schema,
retention/delete behavior, replay collision matrix, payload/privacy bounds,
aggregate identity, terminal recovery rules, and rolled-back-reserver outcome
were underspecified. The frozen schema, operational transition matrix, privacy
contract, collision matrix, and proof details above resolve every finding.
Architecture, senior engineering, reuse/dedup, QA/test, product/ops, docs,
security/auth, and CI integrity all returned PASS before implementation began.

After implementation began, ART PR #141 advanced trusted `main` and took
revision 0025. The human explicitly requested a pull. Reconciliation preserves
the reviewed schema and behavior while moving only CON's revision identity and
parent to linear `0027_shared_transactional_outbox` after
`0026_actor_profile_lifecycle`. AUTH-09D-A adds no shared outbox or authorization seam, so
no implementation boundary or non-goal changes. Final exact-SHA review must
cover this current-main reconciliation.

# Chunk Map: WS-CON-001 Contribution Record And Compensation Boundary

## Rule

One chunk maps to one reviewable PR. No runtime chunk starts until its exact
AUTH, REV, outbox, migration, and human gates are satisfied on trusted `main`.
AUTH owns activation custody; feature ownership never supplies a second
availability writer. Optional evidence chunks are not part of the core order.

## Core dependency order

```text
PLAN -> PLAN2 -> PLAN3 -> 01 -> 02A -> 02B -> 02C -> 03A -> 03B -> 03C -> 03D
-> 04A -> 04B -> 05A -> 05B -> 06 -> 07 -> 08A -> 08R -> 08B
-> 10A -> 10B -> 10C -> 11
```

Optional successor, not a branch in the core release:

```text
separate human approval -> refreshed ART/AUTH handoff -> 09A -> 09B
```

## Cross-initiative gates

```text
AUTH registration -> CON hidden behavior -> AUTH activation -> later consumer/release
```

- AUTH-09A through 09D-A are merged; AUTH-09B activates only the human
  administrative provisioning route, AUTH-09C activates only actor/profile
  administrative reads, and AUTH-09D-A activates only actor-profile lifecycle.
  None grants service execution. AUTH-09D-B/09E must still precede protected
  fixed-service execution. New CON
  ServiceIdentity/static-row additions require separate reviewed AUTH contracts
  before provisioning; no existing ART identity or provisioning result may be
  reused as CON authority.
- The outbox dispatcher owns only claim/invoke/finalize under
  `outbox.dispatch`. Each protected handler has independent approved authority.
- Task claim requires AUTH-PREP and one exact active same-project submitter
  grant. CON-05A first lands the hidden freeze participant; task-owned claim
  composition consumes it after task/assignment locks; `WS-AUTH-001-13` then
  enumerates/registers the exact ActionId, integrates its evaluator, and
  activates. Registration/activation before that freeze proof is prohibited.
- Review claim requires one exact active same-project reviewer grant. CON-06
  supplies only the freeze port; REV supplies hidden claim composition; AUTH
  activates review.claim after both merge.
- Review decision requires the reviewer grant and no-self-review/lifecycle
  guards. CON-07 starts only after the TaskAssignment submitter freeze and REV
  ReviewLease reviewer freeze plus accept-only FinalAcceptance persistence and
  locked decision-lineage contract are merged with non-null policy-version
  lineage. CON-07 then supplies the flush-only participant with no ART/evidence
  work; REV consumes that participant in hidden decision composition, stages
  shared audit/outbox, and owns the single commit. AUTH activates
  `review.decision` only after that hidden REV composition merges.
- CON-07 creates contributions and applicable awards in the Review transaction.
  Reviewer work is sourced from Review; submitter work is sourced only from
  REV-owned FinalAcceptance. REV stages shared audit/outbox rows, owns the
  single commit, and supplies stabilized artifact-hash lineage; no ART call is
  made.
- Merged REV PR #128 is planning authority, not runtime readiness. CON-03B must
  precede REV-03; CON-02A/02C precede REV-04; REV-04 precedes CON-03C; CON-06
  precedes REV-06; REV-09B plus CON-03C/07 precede REV-10; and CON-11's exact
  obligation hooks/ordinal/drain manifest precedes REV-12A.
- CON-08A/B and 10C cannot reuse outbox dispatcher authority for delivery,
  callback, reconciliation, or rebuild execution.
- CON-10A owns core PostgreSQL contribution/award reads directly; it does not
  wait for optional evidence reads.
- CON-11 has no ART or evidence-projection prerequisite. It hands mandatory
  obligation-writer, dispatch, callback, maximum-ordinal, and drain-observation
  seams to REV-12A's single shared lifecycle controller and registers no route.
- AUTH PR #140's complete ART and REV activation-custody transfer contracts are
  consumed by reference to AUTH/WS-XINT handoffs. The runtime transfers remain
  upstream gates; WS-CON does not define partial subsets.

## Chunk boundaries

- 01 owns current specification/ADR adoption and scanner-safe active wording;
  it does not edit archival inputs.
- 02A owns persistence/append; 02B owns generic dispatcher mechanics only; 02C
  owns the shared caller-transaction audit participant.
- 03A uses `ProjectCompensationAdapterBinding`; 03B owns ContributionPolicy,
  versions, rules, and award definitions; 03C/D own contribution/award and
  downstream fulfillment records respectively. 03C references but never owns
  REV's FinalAcceptance.
- 04A/04B add hidden binding and policy services while AUTH actions remain
  planned.
- 05A removes semantic consumers and freezes task assignments; 05B removes dead
  physical schema.
- 06 exposes only a CON policy-freeze capability; REV owns ReviewLease schema
  and wiring.
- 07 exposes only the flush-only decision participant; REV owns Review,
  FinalAcceptance, shared audit/outbox staging, and the single commit. No
  evidence projection is staged.
- 08A is a feature handler with its own protected execution boundary; 08R owns
  rate-control scope; 08B owns callback authentication/composition.
- 09A/09B are deferred optional projection chunks and must be re-reviewed if
  activated later.
- 10A owns core PostgreSQL product reads; 10B owns bounded operations requests
  and typed drain observation; 10C owns independently authorized executors.
- 11 proves hidden readiness and blocks runtime requests on missing provisioned
  service rows while leaving application startup and provisioning available.

## Required reviewer tracks

Every chunk: senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, product/ops,
architecture, docs, and reuse/dedup. Runtime/test chunks add test-delta. Add CI
integrity for workflows, scripts, dependencies, test configuration, or coverage.

## Stop condition

Planning ends after required plan review and human discussion. Do not start 01,
09A, or any runtime chunk automatically.

# Plan: WS-CON-001 Contribution Record And Compensation Boundary

## Proposed approach

Adopt the merged WS-XINT-001 boundary from PR #139 before runtime work, then
deliver WS-CON through hidden, reviewable chunks. The core path is PostgreSQL-
local and has no ART dependency:

```text
AUTH prepares review.decision and locks reviewer authority
-> REV locks and recomposes canonical Review/Submission facts
-> AUTH evaluates once and stages decision evidence
-> REV stages Review/findings/resolutions, consumes ReviewLease, and closes queue
-> on accept, REV creates immutable FinalAcceptance, accepts Task, and completes Assignment
-> on needs_revision, REV sets Task to needs_revision and keeps Assignment active
-> on reject, REV sets Task to rejected with a bounded human reason and blocks
   only the same-task Assignment with its source Review
-> CON flush-only participant creates reviewer contribution and, only from
   FinalAcceptance, submitter contribution plus applicable awards
-> REV stages shared audit and outbox rows
-> REV route commits once
```

Public contribution, policy, award, fulfillment, and operations surfaces stay
hidden until their exact AUTH registration -> feature behavior -> AUTH
activation sequence and the joint REV/CON release gate pass.

## Canonical product model

- `ContributionRecord` is immutable. Every valid recorded human Review creates
  one reviewer `completed_review`. REV creates `FinalAcceptance` only for
  `accept`; one submitter `accepted_submission` consumes that stable fact.
- `FinalAcceptance` is an immutable REV-owned internal derived fact, not a
  public resource command. It has no independent authorization action or manual
  creation API.
- Existing `Submission` plus its `version` and `supersedes_submission_id` is the
  versioned submission identity. WS-CON does not add `SubmissionVersion`.
- `ContributionPolicy` is the stable project aggregate. It has one active
  policy per project and points to an immutable published
  `ContributionPolicyVersion`.
- Each published version has exactly one `ContributionRule` for
  `accepted_submission` and one for `completed_review`. A rule is explicitly
  `unpaid` or `compensated`.
- An unpaid rule creates no award. A compensated rule references one or two
  immutable `ContributionAwardDefinition` rows: at most one `money` and one
  `project_points` definition.
- `CompensationAward` is the immutable evaluated result. Delivery,
  acknowledgement, immutable `CompensationFulfillmentReceipt`, and rebuildable
  `CompensationStatusProjection` are downstream fulfillment concerns and never
  decide eligibility.
- `ProjectCompensationAdapterBinding` binds one project/instrument to a
  non-secret adapter route and canonical service actor. Credentials and
  provider endpoints remain deployment configuration.
- The retired guide-bound economic schema and every semantic consumer are
  removed in two fail-closed chunks. No alias, automatic conversion, or
  executable fallback survives.

## Review and contribution boundary

`ContributionCompensationDecisionParticipant` receives the caller-owned
`AsyncSession` and a typed request containing:

- exact Review, ReviewLease, queue/lifecycle fence, and decision;
- exact FinalAcceptance for accept, otherwise null;
- versioned Submission, TaskAssignment, task, and project identities;
- reviewer and submitter canonical ActorProfile IDs;
- lease-frozen reviewer and assignment-frozen submitter
  `ContributionPolicyVersion` IDs;
- the stabilized reviewed-packet/submission artifact digest already established
  by REV and Submission;
- the originating allowed `review.decision` AuthorizationDecision reference,
  request ID, and correlation ID.

CON validates the supplied locked facts, copies the stabilized digest into
`ContributionRecord.artifact_hash`, evaluates the matching frozen
`ContributionRule`, stages applicable contribution/award rows, returns typed
audit/outbox inputs to REV, flushes, and never commits. It never reads REV or AUTH repositories, evaluates
`review.decision`, calls ART, rehashes artifact bytes, performs provider I/O, or
offers a no-op production participant. Any CON failure rolls back the complete
Review decision.

`needs_revision` and `reject` still create the reviewer contribution and any
award earned by its frozen reviewer rule. They create no FinalAcceptance or
submitter contribution. Automated checker outcomes create neither contribution
type.

The REV-owned lifecycle effects are exact and remain inputs to CON rather than
CON behavior: `needs_revision` sets `Task.status = needs_revision` and keeps the
same TaskAssignment `active`; `reject` sets `Task.status = rejected` with the
bounded human reason and sets only the same-task TaskAssignment to `blocked`
with its reject Review reference. Reject changes no actor grant and no other
task or assignment. The archival `closed/review_rejected` wording is not a
canonical status.

### FinalAcceptance lineage

REV persists the minimal same-chain fact:

```text
FinalAcceptance
  id
  project_id
  task_id
  submission_id
  source_review_id
  accepted_submitter_id
  accepted_at
  recorded_by_reviewer_id
  review_policy_id
```

The external handoff's `submission_version_id` maps to `submission_id` because
the existing immutable Submission row is already the version identity. The
external `policy_context_ref` maps to the exact locked `ReviewPolicy.id`; REV
must prove the Review, policy, project, task, Submission, submitter and reviewer
chain. PostgreSQL enforces `UNIQUE(task_id)`, `UNIQUE(source_review_id)`, and
`UNIQUE(submission_id)`. There is no reopen, replacement, adjudication, or
second acceptance path in v0.1.

Any reviewer-quality sampling is a non-mutating audit after the transaction. It
does not delay FinalAcceptance, create a second Review decision, or alter
acceptance/contribution truth.

Reviewer contributions require direct `source_review_id` and
`source_review_lease_id`, with `source_final_acceptance_id` null. Submitter
contributions require `source_final_acceptance_id` and
`source_task_assignment_id`, with direct `source_review_id` and
`source_review_lease_id` null. Partial unique constraints enforce one
`completed_review` per Review and one `accepted_submission` per
FinalAcceptance; checks reject mixed or missing source shapes.

## Contribution-policy freezing

TaskAssignment freezes `submitter_contribution_policy_version_id` during an
authorized task claim. ReviewLease freezes
`reviewer_contribution_policy_version_id` during an authorized review claim.
Both use a narrow CON-owned lookup/freeze participant, lock the active
`ContributionPolicy` and current published version plus referenced award
definitions and adapter bindings, return one exact version ID, flush only their
own state, and never commit.

Later policy publication changes only new assignments or leases. Retired frozen
versions remain valid for started work. Missing policy configuration is not an
implicit unpaid rule.

TaskAssignment and task-claim wiring remain task-owned. ReviewLease and review-
claim wiring remain REV-owned. CON supplies typed participants, not foreign
models, routes, lifecycle decisions, or commits.

## Authorization boundary

Trusted `main` is `5d353b6`, merging WS-XINT-001 through PR #139. Runtime
catalogue counts remain 74 PermissionIds, 57 ActionIds, nine active actions, and
48 planned actions. No WS-CON ActionId is registered yet.

WS-XINT D1/D2 is final for this plan: `ActionOwner` is the exact AUTH activation
custodian. Each protected surface follows:

```text
AUTH registers planned ActionId, stable PermissionId mapping, typed context,
principal path, and activation custodian
-> CON merges hidden canonical resource composition, guards, and behavior
-> AUTH integrates the evaluator and alone changes planned to active
-> joint release exposes the surface
```

CON never reads grants, imports AUTH repositories, constructs PermissionIds or
roles, changes availability, or supplies a production allow fallback. AUTH
never imports CON repositories or mutates contribution/award state.

The current complete ART and REV custody transfers are AUTH-owned coordination
work. WS-CON references the canonical WS-XINT `AUTH_ART_HANDOFF.md` and
`AUTH_REV_HANDOFF.md`; it does not prescribe a partial transfer. CON depends on
`review.claim` and `review.decision`, but AUTH must reconcile every current REV
action as one complete boundary. The four proposed additive REV actions remain
unregistered until their own reviewed registration contract.

### Human project grants

The shipping path consumes exactly two project authorities: task claim requires
one active exact-project `submitter` grant, while review claim/decision require
one active exact-project `reviewer` grant plus no-self-review and lifecycle
guards. Any unrelated project or administrative grant does not substitute.
WS-CON introduces no adjudicator grant/action, adjudication invalidation
consumer, or readiness dependency; the separate global AUTH role catalogue is
outside this lifecycle contract.

### Prepared mutation protocol

For mutations, AUTH first locks and revalidates either human actor/link/grant
rows or fixed-service actor/link rows. A fixed service additionally requires an
unchanged closed `ServiceIdentity`, exact static service-action matrix
membership, AUTH-09E typed service admission, and active action. AUTH returns a
single-use, non-serializable handle bound to request, session, actor, action,
target, and authority snapshot. The feature locks canonical rows, recomposes
final typed facts, and AUTH evaluates once. AUTH stages one decision and never
commits. Reads use request-scoped `require()` and canonical feature loaders.

Missing provisioned service ActorProfile/ActorIdentityLink rows deny that
runtime request and block release readiness, but do not fail application startup
or the Access Administrator provisioning surface. Startup may fail on closed
catalogue/matrix/context/evaluator/active-behavior parity drift.

### Fixed services and handler authority

The shared outbox dispatcher is not a catch-all feature executor.
`workstream.outbox.dispatcher` with exact `outbox.dispatch` static membership
may claim, invoke, and finalize outbox work only. It cannot inherit compensation
delivery, reconciliation, contribution projection, callback, ART, or provider
authority from an event type.

Before a protected feature handler is implemented, its owning specification and
AUTH must approve one exact ServiceIdentity/ActionId/static-row contract. The
current candidate boundaries requiring decisions are:

- outbound compensation delivery execution;
- asynchronous compensation reconciliation;
- asynchronous contribution projection rebuild;
- fulfillment result reporting by the bound external service;
- optional contribution-evidence binding, if that projection is later adopted.

Suggested semantic identifiers are discovery candidates only, not approved
catalogue strings: `workstream.compensation.delivery`,
`workstream.compensation.reconciler`,
`workstream.contribution.projection_rebuilder`, and
`workstream.compensation.fulfillment_reporter`. AUTH may instead approve a
closed dual-principal evaluator for an existing action, but CON must not infer
one. Therefore the previously proposed 22 core WS-CON ActionIds are not a final
closed runtime count until these service execution boundaries are decided.

The callback path requires a verified service token, provisioned service
ActorProfile/ActorIdentityLink, immutable approved ServiceIdentity, its exact
static matrix row, matching `ProjectCompensationAdapterBinding`, and AUTH-09E.
It never uses a human role or dynamic service grant.

## Operation-specific lock and commit order

There is no global sequence that moves CON policy rows ahead of REV lifecycle
rows. Every mutation first locks AUTH human actor/link/grant or fixed-service
actor/link authority, then its idempotency row and applicable lifecycle fence.
After that common prefix, the owning operation uses one explicit order:

- `review.decision`: REV task, assignment, Submission, queue/lease, Review and
  finding/resolution rows in REV's canonical order; accept-only
  FinalAcceptance plus exact task/assignment effects; the assignment- and lease-frozen
  ContributionPolicyVersion, matching rule/definition, and referenced binding;
  stabilized reviewed-packet and Submission artifact-hash lineage; then
  ContributionRecord and CompensationAward; then REV-owned shared audit and
  outbox append participants;
- task/review claim freeze: the owning task/assignment/Submission or REV
  queue/lease rows first, then the selected published policy version,
  rule/definition and referenced binding, then the frozen lineage write;
- binding retirement or reconciliation that inspects task/assignment/lease
  dependencies: affected lifecycle rows in the same task/REV order first, then
  binding/policy and CON delivery/receipt/projection rows. If the bounded rows
  cannot be enumerated before locking, the operation takes its approved
  project-scoped advisory fence before either family and still locks lifecycle
  rows before policy/binding rows;
- an outbox handler: immutable claim-generation validation without handler
  ownership of outbox transitions, then its feature-owned award, binding,
  delivery, receipt, request, finding, or rebuildable projection rows.

Pure policy/binding administration that does not inspect lifecycle dependencies
locks Project and its own aggregate only. Rows of one type lock by ascending
primary key/UUID. Missing classes are skipped without reordering. Provider or
external I/O happens only after durable pre-I/O state commits and every database
transaction/fence is released.

The dispatcher owns claim, retry, dead-letter, and finalization transitions.
Feature handlers validate the committed claim generation through a typed port,
stage feature state, perform post-commit I/O under their own exact authority,
and return a typed outcome. They do not lock or mutate OutboxEvent rows.

## Optional contribution-evidence projection

A deterministic contribution-evidence document is optional later work. It is
not written or requested by CON-07, does not gate ContributionRecord creation,
and is excluded from core reads, operations, release readiness, and the joint
live drill.

If separately approved, CON-09A/09B may implement an asynchronous projection
with independent status/failure semantics through a separately reviewed ART
capability and AUTH action. Storage failure cannot change Review,
ContributionRecord, CompensationAward, fulfillment receipt, or status
projection truth. The future contract must revalidate the then-current ART and
AUTH boundaries, exact media/schema/retention/disclosure rules, and service
identity. CON never receives ArtifactStore, scratch/preparation types, provider
references, or ART repositories. PR #129's preparation foundation does not
approve this capability.

Core contribution and award reads move directly to CON-10A and read PostgreSQL
truth. They do not depend on an evidence artifact or ART read port.

## Shared outbox

CON-02A provides generic PostgreSQL persistence and caller-transaction append.
CON-02B provides the feature-neutral dispatcher, stable task IDs, claim fencing,
retry/dead-letter/replay, retention, explicit handler registry,
`OutboxClaimValidationPort`, and same-session drain observation. The outbox
subsystem owns no contribution, award, adapter, review, or provider semantics.

## Rollout

1. CON-01 adopts the merged WS-XINT contract and publishes the active
   contribution/compensation specification without altering archival inputs.
2. CON-02A/B/C land shared outbox persistence/dispatch and shared lifecycle
   audit participation, with outbox execution still disabled until its AUTH
   registration, static service identity, AUTH-09E admission, hidden behavior,
   and activation gates pass.
3. CON-03A-D add inactive policy, binding, contribution, award, delivery,
   receipt, and status persistence using the canonical names and boundaries.
   CON-03C lands only after REV's FinalAcceptance persistence target is merged.
4. CON-04A/B add hidden binding and ContributionPolicy behavior behind planned
   AUTH actions.
5. CON-05A removes retired semantic consumers and freezes the published
   ContributionPolicyVersion on new TaskAssignments; 05B drops unreachable
   physical schema after a zero-consumer proof.
6. CON-06 supplies reviewer policy freeze; the REV owner wires it into hidden
   review claim behavior before AUTH activates `review.claim`.
7. CON-07 supplies the flush-only decision participant that consumes REV-owned
   FinalAcceptance for submitter work; the REV owner wires it into the complete
   hidden decision path and owns audit/outbox staging before AUTH activates
   `review.decision`.
8. CON-08A/R/B add fulfillment delivery and callback behavior only after exact
   service execution/callback identities, actions, static rows, AUTH-09E, and
   lifecycle fencing are approved.
9. CON-10A/B add PostgreSQL product reads and bounded operation requests; 10C
   adds independently authorized reconciliation/rebuild executors. Optional
   09A/09B remain outside the core dependency sequence.
10. CON-11 proves hidden readiness. REV release-control composition consumes
    only typed fence/drain ports; the reviewed REV release chunk owns the final
    public route activation and joint live drill.

Every chunk refreshes trusted-main SHA, migration custody, exact port/action
symbols, and merged dependency evidence. No cross-initiative successor starts
automatically.

## Verification strategy

- Isolated PostgreSQL migration, constraint, rollback, idempotency, and both-
  order concurrency tests.
- Same-run repository coverage at or above 78 percent and each new/materially
  changed subsystem at or above 90 percent.
- Exact contribution cardinality for all three decisions and repeated/revision
  Reviews; accept-only FinalAcceptance one-to-one constraints; mutually
  exclusive reviewer/submitter source shapes; automated checks create none.
- Policy publication/freeze races, explicit unpaid rules, immutable published
  versions, and at most one award per contribution/instrument.
- Participant fault injection proving Review/FinalAcceptance/task/contribution/
  award/audit/outbox atomic rollback and no ART call.
- AUTH tests for planned denial, exact grant/static-matrix candidates, prepared
  handle misuse, role-specific revocation, cross-service denial, and one
  activation custodian per action.
- Outbox tests proving the dispatcher cannot execute feature authority and each
  protected handler has an approved independent authorization path.
- Callback/delivery/reconciliation tests with no provider I/O under database
  locks and immutable receipt/award identities under replay.
- Hidden OpenAPI proof before release; exact `/api/v1` inventory at release.
- Stale wording, stale authorization/artifact contracts, Markdown links, loop
  memory, `git diff --check`, and one-sheet roadmap checks when local sheets are
  present.

## Open human/AUTH decisions

- D11 exact AdminRole candidate sets for award detail, delivery recovery, and
  WS-CON audit actions.
- Exact ServiceIdentity/ActionId/static-row design for each protected feature
  handler and fulfillment callback; proposed strings are not executable until
  approved and registered by AUTH.
- Legacy pre-production row classification before CON-05A/05B migration.
- Optional evidence projection remains deferred unless separately approved.
- No adjudication decision remains: v0.1 accept/reject are terminal and no
  adjudication initiative or readiness gate may enter the core order.

## Review and stop

Planning and every specification/runtime chunk require senior engineering,
QA/test, security/auth, product/ops, architecture, docs, and reuse/dedup.
Runtime/test chunks add test-delta; background-execution/script/config/CI changes add CI
integrity. Stop after planning reconciliation. Do not start CON-01 or another
initiative without explicit human instruction.

# Chunk Contract: WS-CON-001-03D - Delivery, Receipt, And Status Persistence

## Goal and risk

Persist outbound identity, acknowledgement, immutable fulfillment receipts and
rebuildable status separately. L1 payment/audit risk.

## Allowed files

```text
backend/app/modules/compensation/{models,schemas,repository}.py
backend/app/db/models.py
backend/alembic/versions/<next>_compensation_delivery_receipts.py
backend/tests/{test_compensation,test_alembic}.py
.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-CON-001-contribution-compensation-boundary/**
.agent-loop/merge-intents/WS-CON-001-03D.json
```

## Not allowed

```text
background executor, callback, adapter, router or reconciliation behavior
provider request/attempt/balance, points ledger or settlement data
AUTH/ART edit, dependency or CI weakening
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Immutable award/event/payload/binding/idempotency identities are retained;
  acknowledgement is not fulfillment; receipts are append-only and terminal.
- [ ] Closed stored values are exact: receipt `reported_status` is `fulfilled`
  or `failed`; delivery status is `pending_delivery` or
  `acknowledged_by_adapter`; fulfillment status is `pending`, `failed`, or
  `fulfilled`. No synonym or provider status is persisted.
- [ ] Delivery state durably represents fenced pre-I/O `in_flight` ownership,
  the originating dispatcher claim generation, retryable recovery and callback
  suppression without storing a provider payment attempt. Crash recovery cannot
  erase or guess whether remote I/O may have started.
- [ ] Status is rebuildable and cannot overwrite award/receipt truth.
- [ ] Callback-before-ack, duplicate exact receipt and changed receipt are
  representable without provider-attempt/balance/ledger data.
- [ ] State constraints permit failed then fulfilled, prohibit any transition
  away from fulfilled, prohibit partial fulfillment, and preserve every failed
  receipt without allowing it to mutate award quantity or truth.
- [ ] Upgrade/downgrade and receipt/delivery races use isolated PostgreSQL.

## Verification and reviewers

Execute CON-03D in `../RUNTIME_VERIFICATION.md`; changed compensation code is at
least 90 percent. Senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, product/ops,
architecture, docs, reuse/dedup and test-delta are required. Stop after schema.

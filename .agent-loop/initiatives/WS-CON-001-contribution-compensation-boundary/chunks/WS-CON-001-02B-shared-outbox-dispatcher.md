# Chunk Contract: WS-CON-001-02B - Shared Outbox Dispatcher And Recovery

## Goal and risk

Implement feature-neutral claim/invoke/finalize, retry, dead-letter, replay,
retention, typed handler registry, claim validation, and drain observation. L1
background-execution/operations/auth risk.

protected feature-handler authority or provider I/O

```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AUTH registers planned `outbox.dispatch` plus its PermissionId and AUTH
  custodian, closed `workstream.outbox.dispatcher` ServiceIdentity with exact
  singleton static row, controlled ActorProfile/link provisioning, AUTH-09E
  admission, typed context, and prepared protocol. Hidden dispatcher remains
  disabled until later AUTH evaluator integration/activation.
- [ ] Dispatcher claims with lease/generation fencing, commits and releases all
  locks before invoking a handler, and alone applies typed outcomes to retry/
  dead-letter/final state.
- [ ] Handler receives immutable event/payload/idempotency/claim generation and
  validates it through OutboxClaimValidationPort. It cannot lock or mutate the
  OutboxEvent.
- [ ] Dispatcher authority permits claim/invoke/finalize only. Tests deny every
  contribution, compensation, ART, REV, callback, provider, reconciliation, or
  projection action; a feature handler cannot borrow outbox.dispatch.
- [ ] Each protected handler must present its independently approved AUTH
  service context/action. Registration rejects handlers lacking that manifest.
- [ ] Stable Celery task IDs, bounded leases, retry/dead-letter/replay,
  deterministic backoff, cancellation, crash recovery, and retention are
  covered with isolated PostgreSQL/Redis proof.
- [ ] Same-session drain observation counts pending/claimed/retryable/in-flight
  work without repository leakage or false zero.
- [ ] Missing provisioned dispatcher rows deny dispatch/readiness but do not
  fail app startup or administrative provisioning.
- [ ] Changed subsystem coverage is at least 90 percent; global floor 78.

## Review and stop

Required tracks include all baseline, architecture, security, product, docs,
reuse, CI integrity, and test-delta. Stop after hidden dispatcher; do not enable
feature execution.

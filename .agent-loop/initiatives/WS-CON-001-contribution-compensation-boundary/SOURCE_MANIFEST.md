## Trusted baseline

- `origin/main` at `93dd392484b397cfdfaaa833631dc2c27f591ed7`, merging AUTH-09D-B
  PR #152 and ART-02B1 PR #151 after planning-only REV PLAN2 PR #150,
  AUTH-09D-A PR #148, REV-02
  PR #147, REV-01 PR #145, AUTH-09C PR #146, ART PR #141, AUTH-09B PR #143,
  reviewed REV planning PR #128, AUTH-09A, AUTH PR #140, and WS-XINT PR #139.
- PR #128 remains planning authority, not Review runtime implementation.
- REV PLAN2 PR #150 is the current runtime-readiness planning authority. It
  splits future REV parent records into executable children but changes no
  backend runtime, migration, AUTH catalogue, or 02A outbox contract.
- ART-02B1 PR #151 adds the S3-compatible ArtifactStore adapter and real MinIO
  proof plus inactive AWS-profile support. It adds no migration or outbox seam,
  and remains outside the core Review-to-CON transaction.
- Runtime AUTH is 74 PermissionIds, 65 ActionIds, 17 active, 48 planned.
  AUTH-09B activates only `actor.service.provision`; AUTH-09C activates only
  `actor.profile.read` and `actor.identity_link.read`; AUTH-09D-A activates
  only the three actor-profile lifecycle actions; AUTH-09D-B activates only
  identity-link revoke/reactivate. The contributor foundation and fixed-service
  admission remain planned. No CON or task-claim ActionId exists,
  and these administrative operations grant no service runtime authority.
- PR #140 remains the source for AUTH activation-custody, prepared-protocol,
  revised chunk,
  operations, and verification contracts. It changes no runtime CON behavior,
  registers no CON action, and activates no feature action.
- AUTH-09B provides the controlled human provisioning path for an approved
  closed fixed ServiceIdentity but does not implement AUTH-09E admission or add
  any CON identity/static row.

## Human boundary amendment

- On 2026-07-17 the human fixed the v0.1 shipping path as
  `Review(accept) -> FinalAcceptance -> accepted_submission` and explicitly
  excluded adjudication lifecycle/actions/readiness.
- Merged REV PR #128 and its PLAN2 PR #150 refresh plan FinalAcceptance, exact
  `accepted`/`needs_revision`/`rejected` effects, two ordered CON participant
  operations, and REV-12A lifecycle-control hooks. WS-CON implementation still
  waits for each exact runtime chunk and consumes no sibling-worktree behavior.
- The amendment's `submission_version_id` is normalized to canonical
  `Submission.id` / `submission_id`; current runtime already stores each
  immutable version as a Submission row.
- Planned REV-04B retains `policy_context_ref` as the foreign key to exact locked
  `ReviewPolicy.id` and `recorded_by` as the reviewer ActorProfile field; CON
  consumes those names and REV owns/proves the lineage.
- `docs/review_closure.md`, `docs/review_final_adversarial_review.md`, and
  `docs/review_adversarial_quality_review.md` are historical internal-review
  recommendations, not live lifecycle specifications. Their older “second
  review” or “overturned” proposals cannot delay FinalAcceptance, add a second
  decision, or gate CON readiness. PLAN2 updates active operations/templates
  only and preserves those review records as historical evidence.

## Normative WS-XINT handoffs

- `WS-XINT-001/REV_CON_HANDOFF.md`: core contribution participant, frozen
  ContributionPolicyVersion, no core ART dependency.
- `WS-XINT-001/AUTH_ROLE_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md`: independent project grants,
  fixed-service static matrix, AUTH-09E admission.
- `WS-XINT-001/AUTH_REV_HANDOFF.md`: complete REV activation-custody and hidden
  behavior choreography.
- `WS-XINT-001/AUTH_ART_HANDOFF.md`: complete 25-action ART custody transfer;
  referenced only, not a core CON dependency.
- `WS-XINT-001/DECISIONS.md`: D1-D13 ownership and transaction rules.

## Runtime observations

- Current code still contains the retired guide-bound economic schema; CON-05A
  and 05B own semantic then physical removal after a human migration decision.
- No ContributionPolicy, ContributionRecord, CompensationAward, fulfillment, or
  WS-CON action runtime exists yet.
- No FinalAcceptance runtime exists yet; merged planning assigns it to REV-04B
  and makes that exact schema a prerequisite for CON-03C/07.
- Existing `Submission` is the versioned identity; no new SubmissionVersion is
  required.
- ART preparation from PR #129 is inactive foundation only and does not approve
  optional contribution-evidence projection.
- Sibling worktrees remain discovery evidence only. Merged REV planning is
  authoritative for sequencing but does not satisfy its own runtime gates.

## Adoption note

The reference inputs contain useful invariants but do not override merged
repository decisions. CON-01 writes the active specification after explicit
approval and leaves archival inputs unchanged.

# WS-CI-001-01 PR Trust Bundle

## Goal

Reduce Backend CI wall-clock time by running the complete test inventory in four
isolated jobs, then authenticate and combine all evidence before the unchanged
required coverage gates pass.

## Design

- Preflight discovers every canonical test module and stable test-base cardinality.
- Deterministic file-level bin packing keeps modules intact across four shards.
- Every shard validates the checked-out tree, uses its own PostgreSQL database
  and MinIO instance, executes whole assigned modules, and proves exact
  same-process runtime collection/completion equality against the preflight
  cardinality signature.
- Fixed bundles bind tree SHA, manifest digest, exact collected/completed nodes, coverage
  bytes, shard identity, and non-secret duration metadata.
- Final `Backend / test` runs with `if: always()`, rejects every upstream or
  artifact inconsistency, combines coverage, and enforces 78 percent global plus
  twelve 90 percent subsystem floors.
- API contract E2E runs concurrently in its own isolated database.

## Scope Control

No backend application code, schema, migration, dependency, existing test
behavior, assertion, skip, coverage floor, authentication, authorization,
artifact product behavior, payment, review, approval, or merge authority changed.
No path-based workflow suppression was added.

## Evidence

- At repaired implementation SHA `ab75b96ba5eba3fad0f127dc1b892c3a804b2c7b`,
  204 shard/coverage-contract tests and 91 agent-gate tests pass; Ruff,
  compilation, loop-state, stale scans, Markdown links, and diff integrity pass.
- The repaired clean-environment dry run discovers 31 modules and 1,775 nodes
  and validates complete four-shard fan-in at weights 445/444/443/443.
- A real local shard proved 445 same-process nodes were collected and whole
  module paths—not preflight parameter IDs—reached pytest. It was intentionally
  interrupted after 246 completions because runtime was no longer a
  proportionate local check; its exact owned database and role were removed and
  verified absent. This is diagnostic evidence, not a passing full-shard claim.
- Earlier unchanged isolated-runner/coverage-contract proof passed 188 tests
  against local PostgreSQL before the hosted repair.
- Ruff, compilation, merge-intent, loop-state, stale scans, Markdown links, and
  diff integrity pass.
- Actions are SHA-pinned; PostgreSQL and MinIO are digest-pinned.
- Workflow permissions are read-only and checkout credentials are not persisted.

## Internal Review

Repaired implementation SHA `ab75b96ba5eba3fad0f127dc1b892c3a804b2c7b`
passes senior engineering, QA/test, security/auth, architecture, CI integrity,
reuse/dedup, and test-delta review. Product/ops and docs identified the stale
trust bundle as blocking, then passed evidence SHA
`f2f35493681ad45ff7e249de0e99b210639cf684` after the hosted failure, repaired
proof model, diagnostic limitation, and remaining gate were recorded.

## Hosted Failure and Repair

GitHub Actions run `29759523305` reached green preflight and API E2E, then shard
jobs failed because import-time UUID parameter display values changed between
the preflight and shard pytest processes. The invalid run was cancelled after
root cause confirmation to avoid wasting runner minutes. It is not success
evidence.

The repair no longer executes raw cross-process node IDs. It executes validated
whole modules, proves exact final collection equals exact completion inside the
same pytest process, and binds stable test-base cardinalities to preflight. A
hosted rerun associated with PR branch head
`76b1d242878c49353178091e41f0435a6c9885d8`, executing authenticated checked-out
merge tree `c2a0ce7c13bb76f6a769dcbca0726de8b244431e`, passed Agent Gates,
CodeRabbit, preflight, API E2E, all four shards, complete fan-in, the 78 percent
repository floor, and all twelve 90 percent subsystem floors. The Backend run
completed in about 14 minutes 40 seconds versus about 27 minutes on PR #161.

Authenticated fan-in recorded 31 modules and 1,775 nodes. Shard execution was
711.782, 135.947, 130.978, and 411.147 seconds, with 580.804 seconds imbalance
and 1,389.854 aggregate runner seconds. This proves the acceleration and also
supports later, separately approved runtime-weight routing; it does not activate
`WS-CI-001-02`.

## Remaining Risk

Collected-node counts do not predict runtime well for migration-heavy modules:
hosted shard durations ranged from about 131 to 712 seconds despite nearly equal
node counts. The workflow still fails closed rather than silently falling back.
Runtime-weight routing remains a separately approved follow-up decision.

CodeRabbit identified that child-runner timeouts exceeded their GitHub job
budgets. The reviewed repair sets shard execution to 4,800 seconds within a
90-minute job and API E2E to 1,500 seconds within a 30-minute job. These
configured budget gaps provide operational cleanup headroom before GitHub hard
cancellation; they are not guaranteed durations because setup also uses job time.

## Human Review Focus

Exact runtime-node evidence, action/plugin provenance, database/MinIO isolation,
fixed artifact set and byte hashes, cancellation propagation, coverage combine,
unchanged thresholds, stable `Backend / test`, and latency-versus-runner-cost.

## Human Merge Ownership

Only the human may approve and merge the PR after hosted exact-head evidence.
`WS-CI-001-02` and `WS-ENG-001-04B` remain inactive.

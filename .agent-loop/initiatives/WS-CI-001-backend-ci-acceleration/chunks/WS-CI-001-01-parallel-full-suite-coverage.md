# Chunk Contract: WS-CI-001-01 — Parallel Full-Suite Coverage

## Parent initiative

`WS-CI-001` — Backend CI Acceleration

## Goal

Run every collected backend test across isolated parallel jobs and combine their
coverage in one fail-closed required Backend check, reducing wall-clock latency
without weakening evidence.

## Why this chunk exists

PR #161 proved the sequential full-suite step consumes 25 minutes 31 seconds of
an approximately 27-minute Backend job. This chunk addresses that bottleneck
before more product chunks incur the same delay.

## Approved plan reference

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Canonical module inventory comes from symlink-safe filesystem discovery
      and includes every `backend/tests/test_*.py` module except an explicit
      declaration for the separately executed isolated-runner self-test; it
      rejects missing, extra, duplicate, noncanonical, symlinked, escaping, or
      zero-test modules and all collection errors.
- [ ] Canonical executable inventory includes every collected pytest node ID,
      including parameterized nodes, maps each node to exactly one module, and
      uses collected counts as initial shard weights.
- [ ] A schema-versioned deterministic manifest assigns every module exactly
      once across four file-level shards using stable weights and tie-breaking;
      canonical serialization binds schema, actual checked-out tree SHA, ordered
      modules, exclusion, node IDs/counts, shard count, weights, and assignments.
- [ ] Every shard validates and runs at the manifest's actual checked-out tree
      SHA with its own digest-pinned PostgreSQL service,
      isolated migrated database/role, coverage filename, and result metadata.
- [ ] Real MinIO remains available to every shard unless executable discovery
      proves and reviewers approve a narrower fail-closed mapping.
- [ ] The API contract E2E proof runs concurrently with shards using its own
      isolated database.
- [ ] Test invocation uses validated manifest node IDs through Python
      argv/subprocess arguments, never a shell-expanded list; a repository-owned
      pytest hook records each node only after its runtime lifecycle finishes.
- [ ] Exactly four fixed-name artifacts bind checked-out tree SHA, canonical
      manifest digest, schema, shard ID, observed nodes, and SHA-256 of coverage.
- [ ] Fan-in accepts only allowlisted regular files and rejects symlinks,
      traversal, unexpected files, wildcard surplus, coverage-name collisions,
      credentials, database URLs, environment dumps, and unnecessary DB metadata.
- [ ] The final required Backend `test` job explicitly fails on any failed,
      cancelled, skipped, missing, extra, duplicate, malformed, or foreign
      prerequisite/artifact.
- [ ] Fan-in recomputes manifest and coverage digests and proves shard-observed
      node union equals canonical nodes exactly once, rejecting missing,
      duplicate, foreign nodes and count disagreement.
- [ ] Coverage is combined only after complete fan-in and the exact existing 78
      percent global plus twelve 90 percent subsystem reports all pass.
- [ ] Workflow `Backend` and final job ID `test` preserve `Backend / test`; the
      final job uses `if: always()` and validates every `needs.<job>.result`.
- [ ] All actions, PostgreSQL, and MinIO references are immutable SHA/digest pins;
      explicit permissions are `contents: read` plus minimum artifact access, no
      repository write exists, and `pull_request_target` is absent.
- [ ] Hosted exact-checked-out-tree proof runs all shards and reports timing
      against PR #161 without claiming success from local estimates.
- [ ] The backend testing runbook documents diagnosis, artifact retention/schema,
      reruns/stale rejection, cost, check identity, progress, and atomic rollback.

## Verification commands

```bash
ruff check backend/scripts/ci_test_shards.py backend/tests/test_ci_test_shards.py scripts/test_agent_gates.py
python3 -m py_compile backend/scripts/ci_test_shards.py backend/tests/test_ci_test_shards.py scripts/test_agent_gates.py
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python3 -m pytest -q backend/tests/test_ci_test_shards.py scripts/test_agent_gates.py
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python3 -m pytest -q backend/tests/test_isolated_database_runner.py backend/tests/test_coverage_contract.py
python3 backend/scripts/ci_test_shards.py dry-run --repository-root . --shards 4
python3 scripts/check_internal_review_evidence.py
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_workstream_wording.py
python3 scripts/workstream_agent_gate.py --base origin/main --head HEAD --format markdown
git diff --check
```

The dry run must perform real collection, plan four selections, synthesize the
expected shard-observation metadata without executing tests, and validate exact
inventory/provenance fan-in. Hosted PR evidence must additionally show all
Backend matrix jobs, API E2E, full
combined coverage, every protected subsystem report, Agent Gates, and external
review passing on the exact reviewed head.

## Required reviewers

- [ ] senior engineering
- [ ] QA/test
- [ ] security/auth
- [ ] product/ops
- [ ] architecture
- [ ] CI integrity
- [ ] docs
- [ ] reuse/dedup
- [ ] test delta

## Human review focus

Inventory exactness, database/service isolation, failure propagation, artifact
provenance, coverage combination, unchanged thresholds, stable required-check
identity, and measured latency-versus-runner-cost tradeoff.

## Stop conditions

Stop and escalate if:

- complete coverage requires shared mutable database state across shards
- a test must be skipped or weakened to make sharding pass
- the final required check cannot fail closed on upstream cancellation/skipping
- coverage artifacts cannot be bound to exact commit and inventory
- a dependency or backend product change becomes necessary
- hosted wall time does not improve enough to justify added runner cost
- scope expands into path routing or `WS-ENG-001-04B`

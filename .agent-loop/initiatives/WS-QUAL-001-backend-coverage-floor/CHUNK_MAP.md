Each coverage-test chunk is limited to 500 implementation lines, except the
reviewed chunk-01A genuine-proof exception capped at 700. Missing its numeric
floor or size budget stops the chunk for replanning;
scope does not spill into the next chunk. A later chunk may start only after the
prior PR merges, post-merge evidence plus initiative `STATUS.md` and global
`LOOP_STATE.md`, `WORK_QUEUE.md`, and `REVIEW_LOG.md` are updated and merged,
and the user provides a new start signal.

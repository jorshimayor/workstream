# Chunk Contract: WS-QUAL-001-01B1A-R1 Normalization Closure

Parent: `WS-QUAL-001` Backend Coverage Floor

Status: user-authorized corrective replacement; internal contract review
pending.

## Goal And Reason

Publish the complete 01B1A parser candidate after closing exactly the two
normalization bypasses recorded by final QA/security review. This replacement
resets the repair loop with explicit known scope; it does not reopen the
superseded candidate for an unbounded third repair.

Risk: L1 test-policy integrity. SLA: P1.

## Scope And Budget

Allowed implementation files: `backend/scripts/coverage_policy.py`,
`backend/tests/test_coverage_contract.py`, and existing 01B1A runbook text in
`docs/operations_backend_testing.md`; WS-QUAL/global memory and reviews are
allowed process evidence.

Forbidden: any parser redesign beyond the two named fixes, semantic Git/delta
guards, 01B1B/01B2 behavior, live config/workflow/evidence changes,
`backend/app/**`, database runner, API, product/auth behavior, skips/xfails,
coverage exclusions/pragmas, or coverage-raising tests.

The complete replacement candidate remains capped at 400 implementation lines
from merge base. Stop immediately above 400 or on any new same-class parser
bypass after the corrective review.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Normalize the stripped PEP 508 requirement name with collapsed `[-_.]+` and
  reject leading-space/case/repeated-punctuation duplicates of pytest-cov while
  accepting exactly one literal `pytest-cov==7.1.0`.
- Token-aware application comment validation rejects coverage-recognized
  `pragma:nocover` and `pragma: nocover` forms in addition to existing
  case/colon/spacing forms, while inert strings/docstrings remain accepted.
- Preserve all 01B1A parser, arithmetic, schema, credential, inventory,
  read-only CLI, scope, and 400-line behavior evidence.

## Verification And Review

Run the full 01B1A contract command set, including exact merge-base scope and
400-line accounting. Required reviewers: senior engineering, QA/test,
security/auth, product/ops, architecture, CI integrity, docs, reuse/dedup, and
test delta. Human focus: only the two recorded bypasses, preservation of prior
parser proof, and no B1B/B2/AUTH spill.

Stop after this corrective chunk. Do not start 01B1B, 01B2, or chunk 02.

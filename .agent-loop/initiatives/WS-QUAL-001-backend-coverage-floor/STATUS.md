# Status: WS-QUAL-001 Backend Coverage Floor

## Current state

- Phase: `WS-QUAL-001-01B1B-R10` contract review
- Branch: `codex/ws-qual-001-01b1b-semantic-delta-guards`
- Authoritative target: 90 percent complete backend application statement coverage
- Diagnostic AUTH-02 baseline: 78.26 percent after database isolation repair
- Final reviewed planning SHA: `0d9dd987d546c864fa8de7bae462e5e73a1b5ea9`
- Final evidence-bound branch head: `3da1769882e9f6db4c48ef3dba33da8380e6a613`
- Planning merge commit: `9046d52f31c7c39f06e06c45c43783bb08a5181c`
- Internal review: PASS after cleanup, signal, authority, CI, and split repairs
- Active implementation chunk: none
- R8 reviewed contract SHA: `9d72e42cf52f0d2da44dc37216fa38b3542dc2c1`
- R8 start signal: user's 2026-07-13 instruction to fix the blocking coverage
  gate after AUTH-02 merged; implementation activated after plan review passed.
- R8 implementation candidate:
  `3acf57281da4638476e70d7ed118e24413c1d20b`
- R8 pre-review proof: 117 focused tests, Ruff, `pip check`, self-applied delta
  validation, repository documentation gates, and 412/700 raw lines pass.
- R8 cycle-zero review: bounded direct-import, enclosing-shadow,
  `unittest.case`, conflicting-owner, PEP 695, and TestCase receiver gaps found.
- R8 cycle-one candidate:
  `1a13beaaf968a00a19c64e702b33026283cf0d22`
- R8 cycle-one proof: 140 focused tests and every deterministic gate pass at
  498/700 raw lines.
- R8 cycle-one review: TypeVar-bound scopes, dotted aliases, nearer nonlocal
  barriers, executable targets, and vararg annotations remained incomplete.
- R8 cycle-two candidate:
  `e2ac216a114bacb4115c7b44efa736e48cd500fb`
- R8 cycle-two proof: 157 focused tests and every deterministic gate pass at
  537/700 raw lines.
- R8 final result: stopped because Python 3.11 uses child symbol tables for
  list/set/dict comprehensions while the implementation assumed 3.12 inlining.
- R9 direction: introspected dual-version comprehension scope selection with
  explicit Python 3.11 and 3.12 proof; implementation inactive pending review.
- R9 reviewed contract SHA: `4da088000d6f059104a08318104fd211a5e9f77f`
- R9 start signal: user's instruction to fix and finish the blocking coverage
  gate; implementation activated after every plan track passed.
- R9 implementation candidate:
  `5a971d80c38cbf856e9eee5bcd49fac6873c38c2`
- R9 proof: identical 161-test matrices pass on Python 3.11.15 and 3.12.3;
  every deterministic gate passes at 546/600 raw lines.
- R9 cycle-zero review: nested 3.12 inline scope and Python 3.13 public
  symtable-type compatibility remained incomplete.
- R9 cycle-one candidate:
  `a5395c173741ee584312e5b69e70676092ce9c46`
- R9 cycle-one proof: identical 165-test matrices pass on Python 3.11.15,
  3.12.3, and 3.13.3; every deterministic gate passes at 553/600 raw lines.
- R9 final result: stopped because Python 3.13 bound/default TypeVar children
  share public identifiers and require one ordered ordinal.
- R10 direction: shared public TypeVar ordinal with mixed-shape Python 3.13
  proof; implementation inactive pending contract review.

- 01A implementation base: `58d44596f614895964b82bb344e0ed98596eaae8`
- Start signal: explicit user start on 2026-07-12
- Split review: combined 01 rejected; 01A database boundary accepted for repair
- Measured whole-app coverage: 79.25 percent; artifact scope: 91.07 percent
- External review: seven CodeRabbit requests repaired and internally re-reviewed
  at `d1582ec64b9176c5ead62f695c7a23b48e4c72b9`
- Merge checks: Agent Gates, Backend, and CodeRabbit passed
- 01B start signal: explicit user instruction on 2026-07-12 after PR #104 merge
- 01B plan review: PASS at `7a16ee4e851b1b10315e32d3f81957acc56bf316`
- Circuit breaker: 480/500 implementation lines before configuration, workflow,
  runbook, and complete negative proof; executable draft removed
- Split review: PASS at `599c7ef1a55345cd54ab8b5b34351f59c52d60bc`
- D8 approval: explicit user start of only 01B1 on 2026-07-12
- 01B1 reviewed candidate: `7bfe3a015d10c250a80a79809e5ee65551cd1775`
- 01B1 implementation: 496/500 lines; 66 focused tests passed
- Review result: blocked after the second semantic-integrity repair cycle;
  test-delta review still requires `skipTest`/`SkipTest`, aliased
  `pytest.raises` deletion, and 0/100/truncation arithmetic boundaries
- Replacement split direction: user approved on 2026-07-12; internal plan
  review passed at `d1819873e5ac353da3963771f70dc2be13bc72f9`
- 01B1A reviewed candidate: `5af95751c554ad022128f78c9dd8c1190f38dec4`
- 01B1A result: blocked at 394/400 after the second parser repair cycle;
  `pragma:nocover` and leading-space normalized duplicate pytest-cov
  requirements remain valid reviewer findings
- Corrective direction: user explicitly authorized fixing the remaining
  coverage blockers while AUTH continues in its separate worktree
- R1 contract review: all required tracks passed at
  `7901de94f4391c107c52ea8733ac72ad34ceb069`
- R1 implementation result: stopped at `c0fa4a2` because the approximate pragma
  regex rejected comments that the installed coverage runtime does not exclude
- R2 contract review: all required tracks passed at
  `6d500e8536e99fa847b77724ee4f211d0eaf4209`
- R2 implementation candidate: `40ac7a9b5a9319b0fdccef396aa82342b324e4c3`
- R2 implementation review: all required tracks passed; 58 focused tests and
  complete 398/400-line scope proof passed with coverage.py 7.15.0

- R2 post-merge memory merge commit:
  `6dccb8e632a6244ca575094be0e3338d49b15856`
- B1B start signal: explicit user direction on 2026-07-13 to run coverage and
  AUTH in parallel using isolated worktrees
- B1B reviewed candidate: `10dff4fbbbefaec17e42cd31ca24593ee59209e2`
- B1B result: circuit stop at 223/300 after the second binding repair cycle;
  lexical shadowing remained false-positive and a local-lookalike expectation
  was weakened to match broader behavior
- B1B-R1 reviewed contract SHA:
  `93e48b45171272f5715d00b2158ed0279e64e5e1`
- B1B-R1 start signal: explicit user direction to continue coverage in
  parallel with AUTH on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R1 result: stopped at its first size checkpoint; the shared resolver
  measured 282 lines before its required matrix, so the 300-line cap could not
  preserve the contract's proof. The draft was discarded without commit.
- B1B-R2 reviewed contract SHA:
  `8a5fc4a801ed63b17075720cf248156d7164da7a`
- B1B-R2 start signal: continuing the user's explicit parallel coverage/AUTH
  direction after internal contract approval on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R2 reviewed candidate: `d4cef1d6042de351419d9bf07209735007cc17a7`
- B1B-R2 result: stopped at 348/350 during cycle-zero review. Stdlib lexical
  cases, control-flow joins, TestCase provenance, `pytestmark`, and local
  `exec` shadowing remained incomplete; the two-line reserve could not fit
  genuine repairs and regressions.
- B1B-R3 reviewed contract SHA:
  `245ab58b371788c02ecfda2c11c5acf859b8c318`
- B1B-R3 start signal: continuing the user's explicit parallel coverage/AUTH
  direction after internal contract approval on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R3 cycle-zero candidate: `10ca5086c52435f41f33e25cae0f94f454e30c8e`
- B1B-R3 cycle-zero result: 468/500; cycle-one findings cover independent
  try/match/loop paths, chained ambiguity, actual binding targets, augmented
  assignment/match captures, future annotations, and inlined comprehension
  contract precision
- B1B-R3 final result: stopped before cycle-one implementation because the
  complete repair and adversarial proof did not credibly fit the 32-line
  reserve; no post-`10ca508` executable edit was made
- B1B-R4 reviewed contract SHA:
  `ac2bcc6`
- B1B-R4 start signal: continuing the user's explicit parallel coverage/AUTH
  direction after internal contract approval on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R4 reviewed candidate: `06a6d61a0246a3975e58c0ddea2319ad74b37ba3`
- B1B-R4 result: stopped at 535/550 during cycle-zero review. Replayed syntax
  corrupted ordinal symtable consumption; loop fixed points, target loads,
  unpack provenance, inline ownership, and optional comprehension effects
  remained incomplete.
- B1B-R5 reviewed contract SHA: `5672971`
- B1B-R5 start signal: continuing the user's explicit parallel coverage/AUTH
  direction after internal contract approval on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R5 reviewed candidate: `5f59f40`
- B1B-R5 result: stopped at 641/650 during cycle-zero review. Transitive loop
  provenance, outer-executed headers, iterable target provenance, evaluation
  ordering, summary pruning, and `except*` sequential behavior remained open.
- B1B-R6 reviewed contract SHA: `bfb2d8e`
- B1B-R6 start signal: continuing the user's explicit parallel coverage/AUTH
  direction after internal contract approval on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R6 reviewed candidate: `68174d1`
- B1B-R6 result: stopped at 800/800 after cycle-one review. Comprehension-
  produced/set/dict element provenance, structural generator consumption,
  nested reachability, and class-global import/AugAssign remained open.
- B1B-R7 reviewed contract SHA: `f0134aa`
- B1B-R7 start signal: continuing the user's explicit parallel coverage/AUTH
  direction after internal contract approval on 2026-07-13
- B1B-R7 cycle-zero candidate: `26a4e6e`
- B1B-R7 cycle-zero result: lazy unknown-call genexpr bodies, unpacked and
  conditional provenance, empty-dict reachability, and class-global transfer
  remained incomplete.
- B1B-R7 cycle-one candidate:
  `a8e1e789f0421c35ecd6f23b9778379fb4b01156`
- B1B-R7 cycle-one proof: 254 focused behavior tests, Ruff, `pip check`, diff
  hygiene, and exact 950/950 candidate lines passed.
- B1B-R7 cycle-one review: structural consumption, empty-comprehension
  provenance, and class-control/import boundaries remained incomplete.
- B1B-R7 cycle-two candidate:
  `5fcd9bb99a733fea9d6b05411ea26c4563375d61`
- B1B-R7 cycle-two proof: 278 focused behavior tests and Ruff passed at
  920/950 candidate lines.
- B1B-R7 final result: stopped after cycle-two review found valid adjacent
  transparent-wrapper, qualified/async consumer, sequential shadowing,
  relative-import, class-expression, method-consumer, and readability gaps.
  No R7 PR may be opened; a replacement requires a reviewed plan and start.

## Stop condition

No coverage implementation is active. AUTH-02 is independently published as
ready PR #107 with all checks passing. Do not start a B1B replacement, 01B2,
or chunk 02 without the required reviewed contract and start gate.

# External Review Response: WS-QUAL-001-PLAN

## Review source

- Pull request: `https://github.com/Flow-Research/workstream/pull/99`
- Source: CodeRabbit
- Review run: `a07b12ca-299c-42d5-8d46-058953c473f0`

## Comments addressed

1. Valid minor wording finding in the internal review evidence.
   Changed “Required merged post-merge memory” to “Require post-merge memory to
   be merged” while preserving the sequencing requirement.
2. Valid PR-description warning.
   Expanded the PR trust bundle/body to include chunk metadata, links, allowed
   files, commands/results, acceptance proof, test delta, internal/external
   review tables, CI integrity, risks, follow-up, human focus, and merge ownership.

## Comments deferred

None.

## Human decisions needed

The planning PR still requires explicit human merge approval. External review
does not authorize `WS-QUAL-001-01` implementation.

## Commands rerun

```bash
python3 scripts/check_loop_memory_state.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_authorization_docs.py
python3 scripts/check_stale_workstream_wording.py
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
python3 scripts/test_agent_gates.py
git diff --check
PR_HEAD_SHA=<final-head> python3 scripts/check_internal_review_evidence.py
```

The static checks passed, including 31 agent-gate regression tests. The exact
evidence gate is rerun after the evidence-only commit; fresh GitHub checks are
required on the pushed final head.

## Remaining risks

No product behavior changed. Chunk 01 must still establish the clean main
coverage baseline before enforcement begins.

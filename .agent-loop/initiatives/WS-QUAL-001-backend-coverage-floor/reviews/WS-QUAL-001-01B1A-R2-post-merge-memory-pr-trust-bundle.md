# Workstream PR Trust Bundle

## Chunk

`WS-QUAL-001-01B1A-R2` post-merge memory

PR: pending publication

## Goal

Record that coverage parser PR #105 merged and preserve the exact checkpoint
before any later coverage chunk starts.

## What Changed

- Recorded PR #105 merge commit `8a4182e` in global and initiative memory.
- Moved R2 to completed and cleared active coverage implementation state.
- Kept 01B1B, 01B2, and chunk 02 inactive behind separate checkpoints.
- Preserved the user's authorization for AUTH-02 to proceed in its isolated
  worktree without touching coverage memory or code.

## Scope And Product Behavior

Exactly five `.agent-loop` memory files changed from merged main. No code,
tests, workflow, config, evidence schema, application, database, API, product,
or AUTH implementation changed.

## Evidence And Reviewer Results

All nine required tracks passed at
`d45671baea5b07b6506e27d1360938fc84039422`. Git ancestry, merge facts, exact
memory-only scope, loop consistency, successor gates, and AUTH isolation were
verified. Internal evidence:
`WS-QUAL-001-01B1A-R2-post-merge-memory-internal-review-evidence.md`.

## CI Integrity And Test Delta

No executable or test delta exists. Loop memory, stale wording, stale
authorization docs, Markdown links, and diff hygiene passed.

## Remaining Risks And Follow-Up

- The backend remains below the permanent 90 percent floor; B1B, B2, and later
  genuine behavior-test chunks remain.
- AUTH-02 is checkpointed at `c894b2f`; its repair reviewers and remaining full
  proof must resume before an AUTH PR.

## Human Review Focus

- Correct PR #105 merge SHA.
- No accidental activation of B1B/B2/chunk 02.
- AUTH and coverage remain isolated by worktree and branch.

## Human Merge Ownership

- [x] Memory-only scope and merge facts reviewed.
- [x] Required internal reviewers passed.
- [ ] External checks passed.
- [ ] The user explicitly approved this specific PR for merge.

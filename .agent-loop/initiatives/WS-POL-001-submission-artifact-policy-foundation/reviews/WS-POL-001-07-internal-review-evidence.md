## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Initial pass found dirty-worktree review, missing direct Alembic assertion, and an unclear helper-script exception. Commit `55cc79a0` fixed those and the rerun found no remaining issues. |
| qa/test | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Initial pass found the untracked migration and missing direct schema assertion. Commit `55cc79a0` tracks the migration and asserts removed task columns are absent after `head`. |
| security/auth | PASS | None | Confirmed stale client-supplied artifact policy fields are rejected, no policy-context spoofing was introduced, and the cleanup does not weaken auth or data boundaries. |
| product/ops | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Found stale project-shell payment fields in `week2_api_e2e.py`; commit `55cc79a0` removed them. Later evidence-missing process finding is addressed by this file. |
| architecture | PASS | None | Confirmed artifact requirements remain project-policy authority and tasks do not own `required_files` / `required_evidence`. |
| docs | PASS | None | Confirmed active docs/templates now point artifact requirements to `SubmissionArtifactPolicy`, `EffectiveProjectSubmissionArtifactPolicy`, and project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy`. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS | None | Confirmed no duplicate artifact-requirement path or missed shared helper was introduced. |
| test delta | PASS | None | Confirmed tests were not weakened; task stale-field rejection and direct migration assertions were added. |
| ci integrity | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Found missing internal-review evidence before this file existed. This evidence file, status update, and rerun close that process finding. |

## Valid Findings Addressed

- Tracked `backend/alembic/versions/0011_remove_legacy_task_artifact_fields.py`
  so the migration is part of the branch and PR diff.
- Added direct Alembic assertions that `workstream_tasks.required_files` and
  `workstream_tasks.required_evidence` are absent after upgrading to `head`.
- Removed task-owned `required_files` and `required_evidence` from `TaskCreate`,
  `TaskResponse`, `WorkstreamTask`, and task creation service code.
- Added task API coverage proving stale artifact requirement fields now return
  422 instead of being accepted.
- Preserved required artifact/evidence runtime behavior through the locked
  project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` and effective project submission artifact
  policy.
- Removed stale task artifact fields from Week 1/Week 2 helper task payloads.
- Removed stale project-shell payment fields from the Week 2 helper project
  payload; payment terms remain in `PaymentPolicy`.
- Removed stale project/guide request fields from `week1_dry_run.py` so that
  helper script remains aligned with the already-merged current project API
  contract.
- Clarified the chunk contract to allow helper-script request-body cleanup while
  keeping product project guide setup out of scope.
- Updated active docs and task template wording so task records describe work,
  source, acceptance, and rejection, while machine-enforced artifact and
  evidence requirements stay under project policy.

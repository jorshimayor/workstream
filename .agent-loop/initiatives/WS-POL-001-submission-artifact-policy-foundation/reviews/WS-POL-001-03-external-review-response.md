## Backend CI Failure

Failing check:

- Backend `test`

Root cause:

- `backend/scripts/week1_api_e2e.py` submitted a packet that predated
  `WS-POL-001-03`.
- The locked project `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` correctly returned
  `pre_submission_checker_failed` for missing required evidence token and
  required attestation terms.

Repair:

- Added `required_evidence_key = "checker_log"` to the E2E evidence metadata.
- Added exact platform/project attestation terms to the E2E worker attestation.
- Added the script to the chunk contract as CI drill alignment scope.

Local verification:

```text
ruff check scripts/week1_api_e2e.py passed.
Week 1 real API E2E passed locally.
GitHub Actions backend test passed after repair.
```

After the reviewed SHA, only evidence and review-bundle files changed.

## Reviewed Change

Scope:

- Replaced the public submission handoff route with `POST /api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}/finalize`.
- Kept internal persistence on `locked_at` while projecting public `finalized_at`.
- Added shared scoped operator authorization for task creators and admins.
- Finalization now validates the full task locked context before running post-submit checkers.
- Finalization now uses an atomic database guard so concurrent finalize calls cannot duplicate audit or checker side effects.
- Automatic pre-review checker runs are audited under `workstream-system:pre-review-gate`.
- Checker-run and task audit API responses include requester provenance only for scoped operators.
- Existing checker-run list/get and task audit endpoints are covered by the API contract drill.
- Terminal Benchmark example proof now uses HTTP-visible lifecycle responses for setup, pre-submit blocking, finalization, checker runs, audit events, and revision v1/v2 flow.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed the finalize boundary, endpoint naming, atomic guard direction, and proof strategy. Low note: true concurrent API race coverage can be added later. |
| QA/test | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed success, idempotency, unauthorized roles, non-latest rejection, invalid locked context, checker-run reads, audit reads, and live API proof coverage. Low note: atomic repository test is sequential but covers the SQL guard. |
| security/auth | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed wrong project managers and multi-role workers do not receive operator-shaped checker, audit, submission, task, or locked-context data. Low audit wording note was fixed. |
| product/ops | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed user-facing finalization wording, system actor audit provenance, and Terminal Benchmark drill semantics after stale wording cleanup. |
| architecture | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed no task-owned checker model was introduced and finalization uses locked project policy context. Allowed-file contract was updated for the touched loop state files. |
| docs | PASS | None | Confirmed operations role wording now matches service behavior and active docs use finalization and HTTP-visible proof wording. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed the shared task authorization helper removes duplicated scoped operator logic; optional duplication notes were non-blocking. |
| test delta | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed tests strengthened coverage without skips, weakened assertions, or monkeypatch-only proof. Low note: true concurrent public API test remains optional follow-up. |

## Valid Findings Addressed

- Replaced public lock-route and lock-event wording with finalization wording in code, tests, scripts, examples, and active docs.
- Added `can_admin_or_task_creator_manage()` and used it for task visibility, locked context, checker-run detail/list, audit events, and manual checker trigger authorization.
- Prevented a worker who also carries `project_manager` but did not create the task from receiving operator-shaped data for an assigned task.
- Added an atomic `finalize_submission_if_unlocked()` repository guard so repeat or concurrent finalize calls cannot duplicate checker-run and audit side effects.
- Added a docstring bridge explaining why the finalize-facing repository method still writes the internal `locked_at` persistence column.
- Made repeat finalization return the already-finalized submission response without scheduling another pre-review gate.
- Mapped automatic post-submit checker audit to `workstream-system:pre-review-gate` and preserved requester actor provenance for authorized operator reads.
- Made finalization reject unfinished tasks, unsubmitted submissions, non-latest versions, unauthorized actors, and missing/malformed task locked context.
- Changed public response projection from `locked_at` to `finalized_at`.
- Split the operations matrix into separate precheck and finalization rows, and documented multi-role precheck behavior against the actual service gate.
- Removed overclaiming helper names and active stale wording around database proof.
- Updated API contract and Terminal Benchmark drills to use `/finalize`, `finalized_at`, checker-run APIs, audit APIs, and HTTP-visible lifecycle proof.

## External Review Separation

CodeRabbit and GitHub checks are external review. They are tracked separately in:

- `.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-POL-001-submission-artifact-policy-foundation/reviews/WS-POL-001-14-external-review-response.md`

## Remaining Risks

- Post-submit checker policy derivation remains future work; this chunk only proves current project post-submit checker execution and visibility after finalization.
- Full reviewer packet visibility remains a follow-up before broader review lifecycle expansion.
- True concurrent public API race coverage can be added later; the current fix uses an atomic conditional SQL update and covers the guard at the repository boundary plus repeat-finalize side effects at the API boundary.

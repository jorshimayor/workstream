After the reviewed SHA, only evidence and status files changed.

## Reviewed Change

Scope:

- Implements local `ActorIdentity` and shared `ActorProfile` persistence for verified Flow actors.
- Keeps `get_current_actor` as the pure Flow-token boundary and adds `get_registered_actor` for explicit registry side effects.
- Creates new `actor_identities` and `actor_profiles` tables, then drops obsolete `worker_profiles` and `reviewer_profiles` without compatibility backfill.
- Makes worker profile activation write `ActorProfile(profile_type="worker", status="active")` through the actor module.
- Applies registration side effects to `/auth/me`, worker profile setup, project routes, checker routes, and task routes touched by this chunk.
- Makes task claim require both a verified `worker` token role and an active worker profile.
- Preserves active/disabled profile metadata during token observation refreshes.
- Keeps persisted profiles as workflow eligibility/audit records, never route permission authority.
- Rewires demo/scripts/examples from `/api/v1/demo/worker-profile` to `POST /api/v1/workers/me/profile`.
- Aligns docs with Flow issuer plus subject as the canonical identity anchor and Workstream actor id as a local durable reference.
- Tightens role wording so Flow issuer plus subject is only the identity anchor; Workstream-owned role assignment is the product-role authority.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Required stale evidence wording to be fixed so the PR no longer claims compatibility backfill or deleted demo UI proof. |
| QA/test | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Added disabled-worker claim denial and deleted demo-route regression coverage. |
| security/auth | PASS | None | Confirmed no valid security/auth findings on the final code SHA. |
| product/ops | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Fixed role wording so Identity Issuer does not read as product-role authority. |
| architecture | PASS WITH LOW RISKS | None | Confirmed Flow auth boundary, actor/profile non-auth semantics, worker claim gate, and documented v0.1 audit ledger coupling. |
| CI integrity | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Fixed the API contract E2E source-ref namespace and kept source-ref validation intact. |
| docs | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Tightened Identity Issuer versus Workstream-owned role wording across docs and scripts. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Added full reviewer provenance and corrected route-registration scope in evidence. |
| test delta | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Added disabled-profile claim denial, deleted demo-route assertion, and gate behavior coverage. |

## Valid Findings Addressed

- Fixed active/disabled profile observation so token-role observation refreshes do not overwrite explicit workflow provenance metadata.
- Added regression coverage proving active and disabled worker profile metadata stays `worker_profile_api` after observation.
- Added a shared `AuditRepository` so actor profile audit writes no longer depend on `TaskRepository`.
- Removed the redundant task-service worker-profile facade; the route calls `ActorService.activate_worker_profile` directly.
- Added persisted-value overposting assertions for `POST /api/v1/workers/me/profile` and task claim so spoofed identity fields cannot write malicious registry rows.
- Added migration assertions proving new actor registry tables exist and obsolete worker/reviewer profile tables are removed rather than kept as compatibility stores.
- Added metadata negative assertions so old `worker_profiles`/`reviewer_profiles` metadata exports cannot silently return.
- Removed stale `/api/v1/demo/worker-profile` usage from backend scripts, Terminal Benchmark example, and README.
- Removed the obsolete Week 1 demo UI package and workflow instead of preserving a stale compatibility surface.
- Documented exact `workstream_relationship_profiles` trusted claim schema and its non-authorizing behavior.
- Updated audit-event docs to match actual `actor_roles`, `from_status`, `to_status`, `is_dev_auth`, and `event_payload` fields.
- Aligned Flow Identity wording so docs consistently name Flow issuer plus subject as the canonical identity anchor.
- Fixed stale evidence after final internal review so the trust bundle no longer claims compatibility backfill or deleted demo UI proof.
- Added a disabled-worker-profile claim regression proving disabled profiles cannot satisfy worker eligibility.
- Added a route-regression assertion proving `/api/v1/demo/worker-profile` is no longer mounted.
- Documented destructive actor-profile migration behavior in the public data model.
- Updated historical internal-review notes to mark removed demo helper behavior as superseded.
- Changed the internal-review evidence gate so ordinary `docs/internal_reviews` notes are documentation, while current gate-satisfying evidence must live in `.agent-loop/...-internal-review-evidence.md`.
- Updated this evidence with full reviewer run IDs and project/checker route-registration scope.
- Fixed the API contract E2E source snapshot ref from an unapproved opaque namespace to `inline:/guides/...`.
- Reworded role documentation so v0.1 token roles are bootstrap request context and Workstream remains product-role authority.
- Reworded API drill docstrings so signed-token roles are bootstrap role claims, not roles granted by Flow.

## Remaining Risks

- The audit event table still lives with the current task-domain models in v0.1. Actor services now use a shared audit repository boundary, but a future audit module should own the model when actor/reputation work grows.
- Existing routes outside the chunk may continue using pure `get_current_actor` until deliberately migrated. This chunk adds registration side effects to `/auth/me`, worker profile setup, project routes, checker routes, and task routes touched here.
- The next Terminal Benchmark live API drill still needs to run through real HTTP calls against this implementation after PR review.

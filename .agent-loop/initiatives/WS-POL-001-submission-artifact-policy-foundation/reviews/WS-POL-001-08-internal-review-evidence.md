## Reviewed Change

Branch: `codex/ws-pol-001-08-celery-project-setup`

Scope:

- Adds Celery and Redis-backed project setup worker boundary.
- Automatically creates a guide-source snapshot and enqueues project setup when
  a draft guide is created.
- Automatically enqueues setup when a later draft guide-source snapshot is
  captured.
- Runs guide sufficiency first, stops on blocking sufficiency, and creates only
  a draft `SubmissionArtifactPolicy` when sufficiency passes or passes with
  warnings.
- Keeps policy approval and deterministic `PreSubmitCheckerPolicy` compilation
  human-owned through the existing approval path.
- Removes construction-state compatibility surfaces: project payment fields,
  guide checklist fields, task-owned artifact requirement fields, generic
  checker-policy version locks, compatibility wrappers, and the obsolete React
  proposal source document.

## Reviewer Results

| Reviewer | Result | Blocking findings | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| senior engineering | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Fixed queue preflight ordering so missing queue config does not leave guide/snapshot rows behind; removed unused checker-policy wrapper methods. |
| QA/test | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Added autostart coverage for no inline agent execution, eager Celery success, blocked sufficiency stop, later snapshot enqueue, and queue-unavailable no-partial-persist behavior. |
| security/auth | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Pinned the Redis image digest; internal automation uses explicit `workstream_system` actor provenance; no Workstream-owned auth session path was added. |
| product/ops | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Normal setup no longer depends on manually calling internal trigger endpoints; project owner still supplies guide/payment terms while Workstream derives draft intake policy for human approval. |
| architecture | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Celery owns the product-job boundary; FastAPI request path does not run agents inline; post-submit/review/revision/payment lifecycle was not redesigned. |
| docs | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | README, ADR, system architecture, first user flow, checker framework, and Chunk 3 docs now describe Celery setup automation; obsolete non-canonical proposal source was removed. |
| reuse/dedup | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Reused existing `ProjectService` agent methods, repository writes, and checker compiler path; removed redundant compatibility wrappers instead of adding aliases. |
| ci integrity | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Added dependency and local broker without weakening CI/workflow gates; reran agent gate tests and demo UI build. |
| test delta | PASS AFTER FIXES | None | Replaced removed compatibility/backfill tests with current-schema absence assertions and new automatic setup behavior tests; no tests were skipped. |

## Valid Findings Addressed

- Queue preflight originally happened only at enqueue time, after the guide and
  source snapshot had already committed. The service now checks queue readiness
  after project/guide existence validation and before mutation, and a test
  proves no guide/snapshot rows persist when the queue is unavailable.
- Redis was first added with a mutable image tag. The local Compose service now
  pins the current `redis:7` image index digest.
- The diff still contained compatibility-shaped wrapper methods for old checker
  policy names. Those wrappers were removed because no live call sites used
  them.
- The Week 2 drill still asserted the removed generic
  `locked_checker_policy_version` and discarded evaluation status. The drill now
  verifies the current guide, post-submit checker, review, revision, payment,
  guide-source snapshot, effective project policy, and pre-submit checker locks.
- A tracked non-canonical React proposal source still contained stale schema and
  lifecycle wording. It was deleted so active docs do not carry obsolete
  architecture.
- The chunk contract originally excluded files needed for the explicit
  no-compatibility cleanup. The contract now records the user-approved scope
  extension and the no-alias acceptance criterion.

## Commands Run

Results:

- ruff: passed.
- Alembic tests: 4 passed in 69.68s.
- Project autostart tests: 5 passed, 188 deselected in 90.53s.
- Project request-body/policy cleanup focused tests: 7 passed, 185 deselected in 93.82s.
- Full project-module suite: 193 passed in 1964.10s.
- Week 1 API demo UI build: passed.
- Markdown link check: passed for 17 changed Markdown files.
- Stale wording check: passed.
- Agent gate tests: 26 passed.
- Loop memory state check: passed.
- Workstream static agent gate: `REVIEW_REQUIRED` for expected L1 diff size,
  risky migration/checker/auth paths, build configuration changes, and test
  delta breadth. Required reviewer tracks covered those findings.
- Diff whitespace check: passed.
- Redis image digest resolved to `sha256:b2b95679e3b46fb51864949ed25ea976fc3a6bcc00a40a1bc00d568cb2822e50`.

## Remaining Risks

- This chunk uses direct Celery enqueue after commit. The service now fails
  before mutation when the queue is clearly unavailable, but a future durable
  outbox would be the stronger pattern for broker outages that happen exactly
  after commit.
- Explicit setup trigger routes remain available for development and repair;
  the normal setup flow no longer depends on them.
- External GitHub Actions and CodeRabbit have not run for this local branch yet.
  They must run after a PR is opened and should be recorded separately as
  external review evidence.

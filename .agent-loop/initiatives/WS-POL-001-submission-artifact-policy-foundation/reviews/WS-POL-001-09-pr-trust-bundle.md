# PR Trust Bundle: WS-POL-001-09

## Chunk

`WS-POL-001-09` - OpenAI Agents SDK Only Project Setup Runtime

## Goal

Remove the production deterministic project-agent fixture runtime so project
guide sufficiency and submission artifact policy derivation run only through
the OpenAI Agents SDK runtime in current production code.

## Human-Approved Intent

The user explicitly rejected the local fixture runtime because it made the
Terminal Benchmark proof look like real agent SDK derivation. The current
product question is whether the OpenAI Agents SDK can derive the project
submission policy from the full guide/source material. Workstream must fail
closed when the model-backed runtime is not configured.

Chunk contract:

- `.agent-loop/initiatives/WS-POL-001-submission-artifact-policy-foundation/chunks/WS-POL-001-09-openai-agent-sdk-only-project-setup.md`

## What Changed

- Deleted `backend/app/adapters/project_agents/local_fixture.py`.
- Removed `project_agent_runtime_adapter` from active settings.
- Simplified the project-agent factory to build `OpenAIAgentSdkProjectGuideRuntime`.
- Added explicit test-local fake runtime in `backend/tests/test_projects.py`.
- Strengthened selector regression tests so the old
  `WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_RUNTIME_ADAPTER=local_fixture` environment variable
  is ignored in `test` and cannot restore fixture behavior.
- Updated README and Terminal Benchmark examples to require OpenAI Agents SDK
  model/API-key settings and to avoid fallback/runtime-fixture wording.
- Added active WS-POL-001-09 loop state, status, chunk-map entry, and chunk
  contract without rewriting prior chunk history.

## Why It Changed

The fixture runtime was useful while plumbing the lifecycle, but it is now
harmful because it can hide whether model-backed setup actually works. A project
guide should trigger Workstream's real project-agent runtime. Tests can still
use explicit fakes, but production code should not expose a deterministic
fixture adapter.

## Design Chosen

- Keep the `ProjectGuideAgentRuntime` port/interface.
- Use OpenAI Agents SDK as the only active runtime implementation.
- Fail closed if `WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_OPENAI_AGENT_SDK_MODEL` is missing.
- Treat the old runtime selector as ignored legacy environment noise.
- Keep deterministic behavior test-local and visibly named as a test fake.

## Alternatives Rejected

- Keep `local_fixture` as dev/test production adapter: rejected because it
  confuses real project setup proof.
- Keep a runtime selector with one live option: rejected because it implies
  another supported production path.
- Move deterministic fake into shared production code: rejected because the
  fake exists only for tests.

## Scope Control

No task lifecycle, checker runtime, post-submit policy, review/revision,
payment, reputation, blockchain, frontend, object storage, or workflow changes
were added.

Historical chunk contracts remain unchanged. The superseding decision is
recorded only in WS-POL-001-09 artifacts and active status/map files.

## Product Behavior

Automatic project setup now requires OpenAI Agents SDK configuration. If the
model is missing, setup routes fail closed through the existing sanitized agent
runtime error path. The Week 1 demo keeps project setup autostart disabled so it
does not imply a configured agent worker.

## Acceptance Criteria Proof

- No production `local_fixture` source remains.
- `WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_AGENT_RUNTIME_ADAPTER` is no longer a `Settings` field.
- Factory builds only `OpenAIAgentSdkProjectGuideRuntime`.
- Selector regression tests prove the old selector does not re-enable fixture
  behavior.
- Tests use `DeterministicTestProjectGuideAgentRuntime` only inside
  `backend/tests/test_projects.py`.
- README and examples no longer document a runtime selector or deterministic
  fallback.
- Week 1 demo startup sets `WORKSTREAM_PROJECT_SETUP_PIPELINE_AUTOSTART=false`.

Result summary:

- ruff: passed.
- Selector regressions: 2 passed.
- Selector/runtime route focused tests: 3 passed.
- Expanded focused project-agent slice: 8 passed.
- Broader project-agent/autostart slice: 31 passed.
- Full config/projects suite: 198 passed.
- Docstring coverage: 100.0%.
- Stale wording, Markdown link, and diff whitespace checks: passed.

## Test Delta

Tests added or strengthened:

- `test_project_agent_factory_requires_openai_agent_sdk_model`
- `test_project_agent_factory_ignores_removed_runtime_selector`
- explicit test-local fake runtime for route/autostart tests.

Tests removed or rewritten:

- old production `local_fixture` outside-dev fail-closed test removed because
  the production fixture adapter no longer exists.

## CI Integrity

- No GitHub workflow was changed.
- No lint/test/docstring command was weakened.
- No dependency was added.

## External Review

External review has not run yet for this branch. CodeRabbit/GitHub findings
must be recorded separately if a PR is opened.

## Remaining Risks

- External CI and CodeRabbit are pending until PR creation.
- Repeated test-local runtime monkeypatches can be extracted later if the test
  surface grows.

## Human Review Focus

- Confirm production project setup should now have only the OpenAI Agents SDK
  runtime path.
- Confirm test-local fakes are acceptable and visibly separated from production.
- Confirm historical chunk contracts are preserved while WS-POL-001-09 records
  the superseding decision.

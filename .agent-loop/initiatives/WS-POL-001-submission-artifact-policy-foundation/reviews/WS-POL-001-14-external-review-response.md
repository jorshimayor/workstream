# External Review Response: WS-POL-001-14

## Scope

External review for PR #79.

This file tracks CodeRabbit, GitHub Actions, and GitHub review feedback. It is
separate from internal reviewer evidence so human reviewers can inspect external
findings without conflating them with Codex sub-agent review.

## CodeRabbit Findings

| Source | Finding | Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|---:|---|
| CodeRabbit | Concurrent `finalize_submission` calls could both pass the in-memory `locked_at` check and duplicate audit/checker side effects. | Valid | Added atomic `finalize_submission_if_unlocked()` conditional update, refreshed stale persisted rows on repeat finalize, and added tests asserting no duplicate checker runs or audit events. |
| CodeRabbit | `docs/current_system_data_flow.html` used stale "locked guide and policy versions" wording. | Valid | Reworded the public flow to say finalization records against the task's server-owned guide and policy context. |
| CodeRabbit | `operations_roles_permissions.md` combined precheck and finalization in one permission row. | Valid | Split into separate `Run submission precheck` and `Finalize submission` rows, and added multi-role precheck clarification. |
| CodeRabbit | Let every `project_manager` read locked context for all tasks. | Rejected | This conflicts with the v0.1 scoped-operator security contract. Until project-scoped role assignments exist, non-admin project-manager access is limited to tasks the actor created. |
